1, american mindset and the media as i read kunstler s latest rant this week it occurred to me that the media has so much to do with our  sensibilities i don t watch any t v because i don t have cable i m aware of what goes on in the wider world via internet news sites but casey anthony and the like are so peripheral to me it s no worth the mention what i m trying to say is if you believe that  is going on turn off the tv the weirdness that is cable news just adds to the average american s surreal existence try this turn off the tv and live work in the garden after work brew your own beer make some new friends and break the plugged in model that is so prevalent today  may happen but taking one day at a time and getting out of the media spin sphere is step one to mental freedom fear and anger won t make your tomatoes grow

1,greta thunberg is convenient opposition because she directs attention to world leaders instead of capital reinforcing the legitimacy of liberal democracy in the minds of the public although greta s project is good and does build awareness for climate change she is allowed to stay in headlines because it is convenient for the capitalist class when she makes hyperbolic statements about putting world leaders against the wall she makes the supposition that world leaders need to be reformed because they are responsible they are not elected leadership of liberal democracies are merely agents of the capitalist class even though some of them are capitalists themselves it may seem counter intuitive but allowing criticisms of elected leaders reinforces the legitimacy of their rule because it implies they are worthy of criticism when greta interacts with trump and bolsonaro by making headlines she perpetuates the idea that the positions of power they occupy are legitimate and should have better people in them greta s criticism also serves to make mainstream media appear legitimate by producing the facade of unbiased reporting we know the news is bogus because they get to select which criticisms of the established order to publish media outlets choose to publish criticisms of elected leaders because it allows them to serve as punching bags distracting the masses to prevent them from examining the capitalist mode of production once greta switches to attacking the capitalist mode of production rather than elected figureheads she will disappear from headlines when her exhortations move to organizing the masses to abolish capitalism rather than participating in liberal democracy she will no longer be convenient for the capitalist class to promote what greta and the organization managing her should do is utilize the platform they have while they can they should progressively become more radical in their message by moving toward statements that presuppose socialist theory instead of liberal theory they should play the media s game as long as necessary to build an organization of people large enough to have its own momentum so that they can go mask off and no longer rely on the media for building the movement

1,stoneleigh at the automatic earth on the nature of political crisis to begin with all human political structures existing at all scales simultaneously are essentially predatory they exist to convey wealth and resources from the periphery to the centre given that we are facing not just a financial crisis but a major political crisis as ilargi has pointed out many times i thought it might be appropriate to explore the nature of politics the art of the possible in a little more depth that will make the nature of political crisis much clearer to begin with all human political structures existing at all scales simultaneously are essentially predatory they exist to convey wealth and resources from the periphery to the centre thereby enabling an enhanced level of socio economic complexity each centre whether municipal regional national or international has its corresponding periphery the region from which it can extract surpluses for more on this concept see entropy and empire during expansionary times larger and larger political structures can develop through accretion ancient imperiums would have done this mostly by physical force integrating subjugated territories into the tax base by extracting surpluses of resources wealth and labour we have achieved much the same thing at a global level through economic means binding additional polities into the larger structure through international monetary mechanisms such as the bretton woods institutions imf world bank and gatt fore runner of the wto the current economic imperium of the developed world is truly unprecedented in scale to simplify for a moment one can build an analogy between layers of political control and levels of predation in a natural system the number of levels of predation a natural system can support depends essentially on the amount of energy available at the level of primary production and the amount of energy required to harvest it more richly endowed areas will be able to support more complex food webs with many levels of predation the ocean has been able to support more levels of predation than the land as it requires less energy to cover large distances and primary production has been plentiful a predator such as the tuna fish is the equivalent in food chain terms of a hypothetical land predator that would have eaten primarily lions on land ecosystems cannot support that high a level predator as much more energy is required to harvest less plentiful energy sources if one thinks of political structures in similar terms one can see that the available energy in many forms is a key driver of how complex and wide ranging spheres of political control can become ancient imperiums achieved a great deal with energy in the forms of wood grain and slaves from their respective peripheries today we have achieved a much more all encompassing degree of global integration thanks to the energy subsidy inherent in fossil fuels without this supply of energy in fact without being able to constantly increase this supply to match population growth the structures we have built cannot be maintained see joseph tainter s work for more on this for the rest of the article
1,i believe the trigger for a severe economic  will be a major catastrophe within the united states or possibly even two or more major catastrophes within a span of months for example a huge earthquake on the west coast or a huge earthquake at the new madrid fault or a suitcase nuke in new york or boston or with my several within months scenario a huge earthquake that wipes out san francisco one month then three months later a dirty bomb blows up wall street then two months later a huge hurricane destroys a coastal city without catastrophes i think the economy would just continue a steady decline but i don t see it playing out that way

1,hard  versus soft  there seem roughly two schools of thought in  circles  was caused by collective poor decision taking by human beings civilization as we know it could have been reformed into a more sustainable form but we failed to accomplish this challenge and as a result will inevitably see our way of life come to an end industrial civilization is per definition an unsustainable phenomenon the laws of physics prohibit civilization as we know it from stabilizing itself the first narrative i would describe as soft  the latter as hard  examples of the latter perspective seem to be found in paul chefurka s writing energyskeptic com as well as gail tverberg s writing i wonder if any of you think the distinction is sensible and if you sympathize more with either perspective either perspective seems to have metaphysical implications if the prior perspective is correct the  of civilization could be interpreted as the consequence of a collective moral failure if the latter perspective is correct it seems that the laws of physics would have to have been chosen in such a fashion as to render our level of complexity possible but none above us of course anyone who takes the first perspective that we simply failed is left with the question of why we failed if it was possible for us to make civilization sustainable it s easy to say that people made the wrong decisions but that leads us to ask why they took those wrong decisions my belief is that what we interpret as wrong decisions were actually the only options that were viable as a result of the maximum power principle which is why i tend to lean towards a hard  perspective as an example in regards to fossil fuels even though not exploiting them is the best option they carry such high potential economic value that i believe any government that would delay burning them would inevitably at some point receive an incentive to use fossil fuels again in addition it seems to me that societies that choose not to use fossil fuels will prove to be incapable of remaining economically competitive when faced with those societies that are willing to use fossil fuels as a consequence they still end up using fossil fuels to me it appears that  is predestined it s built into the system and to get even more speculative it s built into the system for a reason the reason to me appears to be that this situation is a necessary condition to enable spiritual growth which is typically achieved through hardship
1,rant greta confirmed my believes as a pessimist and misanthrope the amount of hostility and vile behavior from adults people from all over the world and major influencers towards greta thunberg has still managed to surpass my expectations here s this young girl being brave doing what nobody of her generation dares to do telling the world what the fuck is up now i don t understand politics that well i believe she s right but even if she isn t the way people are dealing with her is below childish and almost inhumane the list of what s wrong with our planet be it environmental or political is growing with every passing day i don t know for sure if the end of our planet as we know it is coming but it sure does feel like it and yet nobody bats an eye everybody keeps living their ignorant lives the men in power keep digging our graves and as soon as someone like greta speaks up she gets stamped down humiliated and threatened the people in power keep up the status quo at the expense of our future the education system appears to have failed us with how the amount of strongly opinionated ignorant people keeps growing believing in shit idiots years ago didn t even believe in and the people who do see what s happening aren t strong enough to do anything about it our society is doomed to  it deserves to end i m tired of people i m tired of these endless games for power the propaganda manipulation ignorance it s exhausting reading about it every day seeing the well willed get put down in this world virtue is not rewarded don t know if this is the right sub but i wanted to share my thoughts somewhere if this doesn t belong here or is deemed a low effort post i ll delete it

1,the everything short or an update on gamestop hedgefunds and the fragility of the us financial system disclaimer i am not a financial professional of any kind i have a business degree and read financial news for fun but consider my understanding of financial markets to be elementary at best but since many people i ve talked to couldn t even explain what shorting a stock means i guess i know a little more than the average joe the american education system has failed it seems greetings i m going to try to make this post as short as possible so that you have more time to actually read the post linked here because this is some remarkable due diligence after that read these the very very short tldr that i ll be posting as my ss is citadel could be on the verge of bankruptcy due in part to the ongoing short squeeze of gamestock stock through a subsidiary they have billion in reverse repo agreements that are entirely rehypothecated meaning us treasuries they ve accepted as collateral for money they ve lent which they in turn have used as collateral to borrow money a liquidation of their assets through bankruptcy will lead to a liquidity crunch in the repo markets similar to the start of the great financial crisis the difference being collateral back then was mortgage backed securities instead of treasuries but the effect will be the same this is why yields on treasuries have started spiking recently increasing yield means decreasing price now i know this sub leans against capitalism in general so i don t know how many of you are actually invested monetarily or interest wise in the recent and ongoing fuckery regarding gamestop s share price but i did some light searching and couldn t find any posts mentioning it in the last month and a half i know there are some of you here that will find this interesting but the linked post assumes a certain level of familiarity with the subject that i m guessing some users here lack so skip the part below if you have been following the drama and just read the linked threads above and then search reddit for the everything short and read some of the other posts from the last few days background on gamestop gme these terms will be important short a bet that a stock decreases in price an investor borrows shorts a share to sell at the current price with the promise to return it later cover hopefully after the price has decreased if the price goes up they have to pay more to return it than they sold it for meaning they lost money market maker a middleman in the stock market who facilitates transactions between brokerages if you have a fidelity account and are buying a stock from someone on td ameritrade that would go through a market maker the stock shows up in your account and your money shows up in the seller s account instantly but in reality the actual transfer takes days or weeks to process margin call if you borrow money or shares from a brokerage to trade with you are said to be trading on margin the collateral for this is the cash you originally deposited plus the shares you bought with said money now if the stocks you bought dip too much in value or if the stocks you borrowed shorted rise too much you get a margin call this is the brokerage saying you were dumb with the money and look risky now either deposit more cash to your account or we sell your shares cover your shorts forcefully short squeeze a rising stock price forces investors who shorted it to cover before they lose any more money investor might cover by choice or because they got margin called either way more buyers means the rising stock price rises even faster forcing more people who shorted it to cover and so on gamma squeeze hard to explain without going too far into stock options and derivatives etc just know that much like a short squeeze it involves a cycle where a rising stock price forces more people to buy which raises it further in a circle the difference is the people buying aren t people who shorted it but options writers who sold out of the money call options starting a few years ago melvin capital and a few other hedge funds thought gamestop corp was headed to bankruptcy so they started shorting it there is a loophole in the us where if the company goes bankrupt the shorted shares never even have to be given back and the income from selling them in the first place doesn t even get taxed as a gain literally free and tax exempt money so melvin and friends shorted it a lot not just trying to profit from a falling share price but actively driving it down by flooding the market with borrower shares a dropping share price can actually lead to bankruptcy since it makes it impossible to raise new capital for the improvements needed to make the company more profitable the beginning of the fuckery except it didn t go bankrupt and instead through new leadership and announcement of new business plans it started to increase in price now when you short a stock you have to pay interest on it to the brokerage you borrowed it from and that interest rate goes up the higher the stock price goes since the chance of you not giving it back goes up because it s too expensive for you to buy melvin almost ran out of money to pay the interest and had to take money from citadel now here s where the fuckery ramps up citadel has two branches that supposedly operate separately from each other a hedge fund and a market maker so citadel the hedge fund through its investment in melvin has a vested interest in lowering gamestop s share price so that melvin doesn t go bankrupt paying interest on their borrowed gamestop shares and citadel the market maker processes transactions for robinhood and many other discount stock brokerages you can see how this culminated in the late january drama where gamestop s exploding share price led to citadel forcing their client brokerages to not allow investors to buy gamestop shares after seeing a run up in gamestop s price from about a share to over in less than a year over gain and then crash down to many assumed the short squeeze was over which i assume is why there hasn t been a lot of talk about it here recently however there is evidence that january s share price rise to was not from shorts covering but from options writers delta hedging buying more shares as the share price rises to sell to investors who bought call options at prices higher than the market price when the option was sold citadel melvin and all their friends are still short on gamestock which has started act of it s short squeeze this brings us back to the present and why the linked article is important

1,a personal theory on the next four years since biden got elected i have a theory on american politics it goes a little like this in when obama got elected the economy was in shambles after an unpopular republican president obama and the dems controlled the house and senate for two whole years and all they were able to do was give wall street an extra trillion dollars then in the tea party made major gains during the midterms thanks to massive spending by right wing groups and the dems lost the house was similar to fast forward to now the economy is in shambles and there was an unpopular republican president right wing groups have not only continued spending but now militant right wing groups are emboldened which has in turn galvanized more left leaning groups into action such as blm what i envision for the biden administration is a speed run of obama s first term which i think will just skip obama s first term policies and jump right to his second term policies what this means is in the gop will make massive gains and further cement the common people against each other while the rich and the politicians make the gains the gerontocracy that runs the country will be further solidify their position once biden steps down in favor of kamala before the election the dems will lose in to a tom cotton type full blown fascist since americans will have forgotten trump by the end of january by america will not only be a neo fascist state but will be a full blown dead empire but americans won t understand that because they never have

1,the next great human evolution or how i learned to love  from the article pontoon archipelago or how i learned to stop worrying and love  excerpt the grand cruise liner of modern industrial civilisation has been taking on water for some time now the engineers deep in the hull have reported that it s gushing in faster every day through multiple breaches they say it s beyond patching now they say there s a very good chance the ship won t make it unless it s immediately dry docked for repairs but that is unlikely to occur those on the bridge have heard the engineers assessments but they are at loggerheads over what to do some are ready to act urgently while others doubt the engineers assessment and want to stay the course even if the engineers are right they say they ll surely find a way to fix it just in time the word has also spread throughout the passengers decks some have descended into the hull and have joined the bailing effort others have ascended to the bridge and are banging on the windows demanding those at the helm act swiftly at some point some of those pounding on the glass will break through and in their attempt to commandeer the ship there will be blood pointlessly spilled yet most passengers even if they ve heard the rumours are either too distracted with the onboard entertainment or all you can eat buffet if the ship is going down they say to each other then why are the waiters still refilling the dessert bar meanwhile others passengers have taken refuge in the bar where they sit sunken into their chairs paralysed in despair then there are those who have quietly disembarked the ship look overboard and you ll see them they re not fleeing for dry land though they re staying close by you ll see more paddling toward rafts they ve built from whatever they could harvest with their own hands in groups that seem to grow and contract on a loop as if breathing they are working feverishly yet creatively and playfully they re building structures on the water only to pull them down again and reconfigure until they settle on a more elegant shape the more who join the raft builders the more elegant their structures become some return to the ship for a time to learn to understand what might be useful and to bring these things back to the rafts and integrate them into their structures not all newly assembled structures seem to work in fact most don t they are experimenting with different combinations of novelty and time tested traditions rebirthing the latter and fusing it with the former the results are unpredictable and many rafts sink midway through construction and so it goes they muddle along until they find some way of being all at sea some builders occasionally glance back at the ship and wonder if they ve made a mistake right now the ocean liner is afloat above the water line there are few signs of distress you can even see people sipping pina coladas on the sun deck and playing shuffleboard the band is still playing can this really be what a sinking ship looks like but they know that once a threshold is crossed the weight of water filling the hull will drag the entire hulk beneath the waves within mere hours the builders do this work because when the ship s descent into the abyss accelerates those aboard will need to look to something that will abate the terror something to swim towards they will need to see something that offers a hope beyond hope that they might climb aboard or even emulate what the builders have created may look shabby now but all elegant things begin in exactly this way they know this and they share stories with one another that speed along this transmutation their transition may take decades perhaps centuries they ll carry on working together they re dreaming of a pontoon archipelago where the sun never sets without music amp xb my thoughts if you only read one article this week i would highly recommend this one every accomplishment and evolution of the mind mankind has ever made only came from making and learning from mistakes

1,the almighty dollar i remember reading a book that basically showed that the only reason people accepted that american dollars have any value is because the usa keeps the dollar as the worlds oil reserve currency which means that if anyone wants to buy oil they have to do it in dollars whenever a state or nation tries to go against this the us fucks their shit up this allows the us to literally just print money for themselves because if anyone doesn t like it they are the enemy and can t get oil and they have trade sanctions imposed on them the book explained that that s why the us spend so much on the military because it s literally the only think keeping the wealthy wealthy no real benefit of being a billionaire if a bag of potatoes costs anyway i m not sure of the valididty of the above and i can t remember the name of the book so please correct me if this is wrong or bs

1,seeing the forest for the trees part two i m not writing this to depress anyone or to suggest hopelessness to the contrary i believe the attaining of knowledge and an ability to see the forest for the trees so to speak offers us the opportunity to prepare our minds hearts and support systems for what s likely to come what we find when we zoom out and absorb the entire picture is a totality of circumstances that is pleading with us to recognize it fully it s clear by simple analysis of the facts that anyone who chooses to ignore these pleas or fails to hear them will find themselves in real peril in the very near future this is what our circumstances promises us most likely in the near term i m not solely talking about climate change abrupt or otherwise though i will discuss it i m not talking solely about financial economic catastrophe though i will discuss it i m not talking about the threat of war or civil unrest or agricultural  and famine or water shortage or sea level rise or rising fascism and nationalism or terrorism or cyber attack or earth population overshoot and natural resource depletion or pestilence or grid failure or mass extinction and ecological  or some unforeseen and catastrophic natural disaster each one of these alone could easily and feasibly mean the end of modern civilization as we know it each one of these by themselves represent very real and very present threats to the entire planet and or to civilization as a whole taken all of these things together it becomes much easier to discern the bigger picture and precisely why we should pay attention to it i ll be doing this in parts as it seems like quite a lot to tackle in one post i ll try to do everything i can to source each of the threats in question with reputable materials please don t take any one thing as the issue all of what i will be discussing is the issue they all affect one another many will directly lead to others like falling dominos it will be inevitable again this is not to depress but to empower i implore you to see the bigger picture the forest for the trees amp xb the fragility of developed civilization part two the planetary insanity of infinite growth amp xb continuing with the theme of the fragility of developed civilization is the total absurdity of the basis of its economic structuring as a whole eternal growth the total land surface area of our planet is about million square miles million of which is currently habitable and holding a population of billion human beings on those rapidly shrinking habitable sections but i digress these numbers seem to me to be finite so how is it that a system based on a model of infinite resourcing of our finite planet can be considered in any way shape or form viable logic would follow that it isn t viable if it s not viable by reasonable deduction it would be inherently unsustainable unstable and destined to fail would it not amp xb there are a few facts that cannot be argued i was born and i

though it lies near its hot edges our atmosphere has been able to shield humanity from the heat of our supporting star fairly efficiently we are now performing a dangerous game of chicken with that atmospheric protection our planet is also the only planet which we know of within reach that can support us and life overall our planet has limited space our planet has limited fresh water our planet contains limited natural resources our planet is able to sustain life due to a delicate balance of all its resources organic and inanimate that is inarguable that is fact amp xb every resource we extract burn exploit changes the delicate balance on our planet every drop every ounce of resource we mine siphon bleed squeeze from our planet and then burn or otherwise exploit brings us that much closer to that resource no longer existing don t get me wrong many of these resources will be replenished several thousand million or billion years in the future depending on what that resource is however those resources won t be here anymore supporting humans earth s systems simply cannot keep up with our exploitation we are chewing off the very limb on which we stand our developed civilization is built on earth s finite resources those resources will run out and our current system of supporting ourselves will fail these are all facts that aren t going away they re becoming much more tangible and undeniable consequences of depletion of natural resources amp xb i mentioned that many of the situations we face are extremely interconnected and this is very much an example of that as the resources deplete prices will rise this will strain the scantily build economies of the world which are supported by insolvent monopoly money whose only value is based purely the faith of the public which will be quickly evaporating along with the resources on which we depend this is already starting amp xb water is becoming more difficult to reach if not completely running out in india australia in the aquafers that support agriculture in the us just to name a few we are employing more and more expensive means to extract nearly every last natural resource we can get our hands on because we ve exhausted all ones that were easy to get to it s not going to be long before these depletions begin to affect the worlds economies again all these fragile systems are connected and interdependent as are we if we choose to blindly rely on them being unwavering they are not the world is running out of fresh water amp xb i will be coming out with the next post in this series shortly be well and peace amp xb r leftprep post and discussion
1,anti civ panel with john zerzan discusses  chomsky transhumanism and other topics this whole talk was good but i ve condensed it for you here into what i thought were the best segments most relevant to discussion i see going on here in r  mins zerzan gives an overview to mins chomsky red anarchism vs green anarchism seconds into part of the video mins discussion of transhumanism ends at mins good q amp a from here to the end
1,how many of you folks are planning to become weaponized hermits i saw the post about what to do with finances pre big one and a lot of people were advocating buy land one road in get guns i m just thinking damn i d hate to ride this shit out alone shooting at anyone who wandered onto my property it just doesn t seem incredibly smart to go at this completely alone or with just your family not to be super judgemental i get it we ve been conditioned to be incredibly self reliant but i m not sure that s been super beneficial
1,everything uses fossil fuels i ask this question a lot to my colleagues and think it s both a terrifying question that s nearly impossible to answer and a great thought experiment can you name any product or service we use that does not at some level no matter how granular or end stage involve the use of fossil fuels i ll try to respond to as many responses as i m able
1,any tips for how disabled individuals can best prepare a short version of my situation i m heavily mobility impaired it s not a situation where i can get in shape to make it better since it s a neurological issue along the lines of parkinson s i rely on mobility aids to be able to get around the house mostly crutches sometimes a walker on bad days i have a very lightweight wheelchair for trips out of the house i live surrounded by family which i think is one good thing i have going for me my mother grandmother aunt and uncle and several cousins all live on adjacent plots of land collectively i d say it s around acres though it s in everyone s names separately we all have gardens there s a decent amount of unused land a lot of woods around for foraging lots of wildlife wandering through these things all make me feel a little better but i get absolutely terrified thinking about my physical limitations i don t know what i can do that s worthwhile i don t have skills that would be very useful in a  my background is in creative writing and web dev which i doubt will be in high demand do you have any advice for practical skill sets i could focus on i still have pretty decent control of my fine motor skills the first thing that comes to mind is sewing but i want to know if there s anything else worth looking into basically anything that doesn t involve weight bearing kneeling bending etc another question what should i focus on for long term preparation i know the basics about stocking up on medication and first aid but i m wondering if anyone has input re mobility i m really torn between whether i should focus on hunkering down and making my homestead more accessible and self sufficient or if i need to spend money and energy on getting ready to run if i have to for example a more rugged terrain wheelchair if that kind of thing even exists i don t even know where to begin with this scenario though sorry this is so long the physical issues just add an extra layer of fear and confusion for me i don t know what to do so i get overwhelmed and i end up doing nothing i d appreciate any advice at all
1,i find it insane that so many countries and people care so much about afghanistan but don t give a crap about climate change this was meant to be posted in r unpopularopinion but it got removed because no politics amp xb our world is on the brick of  because of climate change i am pretty sure that we are gonna witness many countries in the following years getting pulverized by intense weather phenomena scientists have spoken we have been warned goverments should be taking measures already on how to save the world there is no fucking time left people should be in the streets demanding big corporations to stop destroying our world why no one seems to care about the wellbeing of the entire wolrd but when things like the  of afghanistan happens everyone seems to get emotional countries are sending help almost immediately people are sending thoughts and prayers awww we need to save those little afghan bastards talibans are so cruel you know who is more fucking cruel corporations that polute the oceans rivers lakes our oxigen expoilt children etc etc we have been manipulated into thinking that our worst problem right now in afghanistan while the world is getting destroyed right in front of our eyes when your house will be burned be taken by a flood destroyed by a hurricane trust me afghanistan will be the least of your problem and countries wont be able to send any help because they will be dealing with their own  thoughts and prayers to us all
1,the root of all humanity s problems lies in the lack of empathy is this not true starting with wars in which there are two sides or more each one has their reasons and believes themselves to be superior in morals to the other but nobody realizes that they could have been born on the other side then they would probably support the other side and believe that they have moral superiority another topic religion there are thousands of religions but supposedly each one claims to be the superior and correct one while the others are wrong what madness is that and the worst thing is that some religious people think that they have the moral superiority to tell other religious or atheists that you will burn in hell but wouldn t they have burned too if they had been born into another religion now feminism the problem we have with women s rights is due to the lack of empathy many men simply do not understand why women ask for more rights because they are simply not women nor do they know what it is to live being a woman then comes homosexuality we all know that heterosexuality makes up the majority of society if we add to that that humanity lacks empathy it creates a perfect storm against homosexual people from there comes all the hatred towards these people because the majority of society has never been homosexual and will never understand that it is not it is a choice now what does this have to do with  well very simple if humanity does not improve in empathy we will never pass the great filter if the majority of advanced western societies do not suffer in their own skin what children suffer with famine and easily treatable diseases in africa if the majority do not suffer in their own skin the annual floods and devastating fires if the majority are not deprived of electricity drinking water and internet if the majority do not suffer in their own skin the bloody wars for resources we will never change so there are only two options either a catastrophe occurs on a global level and more than of advanced societies suffer it or we don t wait for that to happen and we improve as human beings and we start acting before it s too late the third option is not an option it is simply an unprecedented dark scenario that we cannot predict it is the scenario in which human civilization s because of our toxic individualism

1,a green fascist future i ve been a long time follower of some of the  websites auto earth kunstler orlov i m wondering if on our long descent we re going to pass through a green fascist stage my description of green fascist is environmentalism is forced upon the populace for example driving cars eating meat heating cooling access to electronic gizmos is tightly controlled not permitted birth rate control similar to china s one child policy however the military and elites aren t subject to these policies for example dwindling electronics production is dedicated to military and population monitoring elites can drive cars eat meat facism is such an overloaded word but i could imagine political symbols based on trees or gaia or something like that echos of or soylent green

1,space travelling while some of us try to diminish their effect on the ozone layer by sharing rides riding public services recycling or avoiding taking the plane altogether too often our leaders will slap us in the face by taking their private jet in order to attend very important meetings but that s not even the icing on the cake what s the next big thing you might ask space travelling forget the private jets they don t pollute quite enough all aboard well just guy lalibert sir richard branson and jeff bezos not you you re too poor for that our private rocket ship and let s go right up to space the amount of pollution avg of typical car running for two centuries for the amount of time spent in orbit is unbelievable polluting the home you live in to better admire its surroundings is ironic af i believe they make these things you know uhm what are they called again ah yes telescopes and i think it s just the start the space travelling industry is just getting started soon the billionaires of this world won t be satiated with their status of humble billionaire and will happily drop k for a min round trip around earth to have a picture of themselves in a spacesuit they ll be able to post on their social media feeds and or hang on their giant mansion walls on the bright side maybe once they see our small blue sphere from space they ll finally come to the obvious conclusion and post some vapid attention seeking posts with pictures of earth and some condescending billionaire new age text this is our home and we only have one we need to take care of it

1,risk of religious extremism genocide and scapegoating in u s during the  i have a great fear that as the  gets worse people will turn to religion for answers and find scapegoats to blame for the chaos some of the comments i read on sites like zerohedge com are unbelievable the hatred toward minorities blacks gays mexicans etc is quite obvious and common and they are blames for the decay of the country i fear that the anger that is being generated by the  will lead to mass murder and possibly genocide right here in the united states as people lose jobs go hungry become homeless etc they will look for someone to blame blame of course is a way to shift pain and discomfort onto someone else reason logic and critical thinking will probably take a backseat to religion and irrationality what are your thoughts do you see the anger and resentment resulting from a collapsing country and world could lead to such events in the united states could it get that bad as the fight for resources grows more intense was the holocaust a preview of what could come on a much larger scale i know this is a pretty dark topic but it really weighs heavily on my mind we often take safety and security for granted in this country please share your thoughts

1,memes and philosophical failures will also cause  these are real failures and they are not going to be getting better we had every tool necessary to have handled the coronavirus better we have the social means to close borders and businesses on a mass scale agencies to handle the legwork we have technology for life support and creation of medications and vaccines there were countries that had every tool in the bag and still faced losses several magnitudes larger than countries that did not vietnam is a tiny country with a fraction of the economy of most western countries and yet somehow they were able to protect their populace and have magnitudes fewer casualties than many larger economies what we are seeing in western countries are deaths caused by the final death throes of objective truth while some will hem and haw that they have been protected by their proximity to objective reality the social reality is that there is no overall movement of humanity to find objective truth and provide it to all under the assurance of good faith what the coronavirus pandemic represents is not only the spread of a literal virus but the successful spread of a mind virus a meme in places like brazil the victory for this meme was all too easy the meme of the virus is not that bad had won over a meme of general control and mitigation this has brought a country with a very advanced economy and abundant resources to it s knees we will be for the foreseeable future be guided and pushed in the direction of memes of convenience rather than memes of rigor and analysis while there was once a time where each one of us could do our due diligence to look at all the facts read through all the articles even listen to experts and their logic and come to stable conclusions our modern world is much different we don t always have all the facts because the information we have is like a firehose and each fact is like a droplet of water to be seen or lost at a moment s notice most people don t read through articles they read headlines and articles are being more and more editorialized and twisted to serve native advertising and other agendas the experts could be experts or they could be one of thousands of other grifters popping up using the ridiculously accessible megaphone of modern media to add their voice to an overwhelming chorus of voices regardless of your proximity to objective truth there are billions of people who are only seeing bits and pieces of it and then spreading those malformed memes to others spawning an exponentially increasing number of alternate realities where no one knows what is real what is important or even what to look at we don t live in a world where objective reality can even be found anymore it is a desert of reality drowned out by the cascading explosion of a war between effective and ineffective memes anything we care about any problem we think is important is unlikely to be solved because there is no longer a way to create a mutually agreed upon framework for the urgency of any issue and that means nothing gets done and nothing ever gets fixed

1,views on the green party as an american this will unfortunately be another us centered post feel free to write about your own nation s green parties though with the election coming and with the seeming lack of interest in environmental policy from biden kamala i have been looking at the green party as being more in line with my views howie hawkins the green party presidential candidate speaks well on what little airtime that i could find on youtube i m liking the green new deal though as with when bernie sanders had one it seems very far fetched and lacking on details still it is a start compared to biden s probable inaction and trump s literal destruction obviously the green party has no chance on winning the election still i would like to think that if enough people support them the dnc might see how they are alienating the more progressive environmentalist side of their party giventhat i am in a blue state where my blue vote means almost nothing a green vote would maybe show where my views actually lie so what does this sub think of the green party have you been voting them or do you think they are a joke would the green new deal move us to a better position against the coming ecological  does voting for an obvious loser in a party system make any sense

1,what do the members of the elite think of the coming  cassandra s monday post how will the elite react to the upcoming seneca cliff amp xb amp xb
1,opinion elected officials and governments as a whole should fear the people in their charge i feel like this is a fact that is plain to see that modern governments do not fear the people they govern it seems like this is the norm as the technological and military strength of those in charge exponentially exceeds that of average citizens this is not how things should be for when those who rule do not fear recompense for their actions corruption nepotism and chicanery spread like a wildfire then we all suffer indignities and injustices that should not happen to begin with i feel that throughout history leaders and their armies always had an advantage over the common folk but rising up was a possibility certainly advantages like how to fashion gunpowder and smithing techniques were safeguarded and literacy played a huge role in strategic planning that peasants just didn t have but today the levels of surveillance and propaganda psyops would make the kings of old weep with joy at the ability to monitor those they rule over or stare in horror at the eradication of privacy and dissenting voices for the greater good but back to my main point if these protests around the world but in my country mainly the us of a have shown me anything is that there is no respect and certainly no fear for the common man brutality at protests of police brutality aiming for the face with rubber bullets uniforms with zero identifying markers on them police firing upon people on their own property for standing on their own porch after curfew it s horrifying signifying to me that the ruling elite do not fear us one bit one iota the cops on the frontlines fear for their lives but those who give the orders build the policies culture from ivory towers or bunkers fear for their loss of profits human capital stock that s all we are to them little things that consume and work all our lives to buy things we don t need with money we only temporarily have any system of governance cannot function without an underclass those who work but can never get ahead essential workers economies are built from the bottom up and they need us so much more than we need them the ruling class but while million americans are left in the lurch the rich got richer during this time of crisis they buy influence and rewrite laws to better suit themselves a prime example in some states it s illegal to sleep in your own vehicle why who wrote that law who does it benefit who sleeps in their cars the disenfranchised and the unlucky victims of our capitalist society that then receive a ticket for their last resort option before the streets that is a law that fills coffers and benefits no one but those who wrote it this is what happens when there will be no rebuttal from the citizenry as we are too distracted by our bread and circuses too afraid to rock the boat lest our feet get wet or our own comfortable seat be overturned by the rocking this is what the ruling class counts on finally i do not want violence i don t want anyone to die for any cause there is enough for us all enough land enough food and enough wealth for us all but the obscenely wealthy do not want to share they want to have it all akin to dragons on their hoards the ruling elite want it all and if they can t have it they will doom us and the planet rather than live in anything other than opulent splendor they militarize the police and some even have private armies and i personally believe that will become more common as disparity gets worse as a result of their self enriching policies the real looting is in the treasury the real looters are in congress i don t want to revolt i don t want to hurt anyone but i don t see any change being handed to us so we must take it by force people died for the eight hour work week people died for our country to secede from the british are we willing to die for wealth redistribution and police reform the second amendment which i believe in is a joke how are we to fight drones and tanks and apcs with our little ars and kalashnikovs it is a hollow gesture to allow us to believe we can overthrow them but we never will or could if we tried even now most of the gun owners i know conservatives with stickers all over their trucks are saying to respect authority and police as they shine the oppressors boots with their tongues that s the crux of it oppression comes in forms familiar to us as our brothers and sisters as our sons and daughters as people who say things like if you ve done nothing wrong you have nothing to fear welcoming fascist tendencies as long as it hurts the right people without fear of the people of us our leaders act with impunity they should fear us fear our guillotines but they will just invest in ways to beat us down instead of helping us off of the floor it is immoral to have far more than you will ever need even if you came to have excess through hard work and smart decisions i fear this is a lesson that will eventually be taught through force and the powers that be will have no one to blame but themselves

1,record arctic blazes may herald new fire regime decades sooner than anticipated the arctic summer of was supposed to be an outlier featuring massive blazes in siberia including what scientists strongly suspected were smoldering fires beneath the peat in the carbon rich soils of the transition zone between the tundra and arctic taiga last year set records for emitting planet warming greenhouse gases via wildfires many scientists thought it might be a one off considering that computer model projections tend to show that the emergence of such extreme fire years won t happen until mid century however this year is proving those scientists wrong and it raises the unsettling possibility that fire seasons that begin much earlier than average and end later and affect delicate arctic ecosystems could soon be the new normal wildfires continue to burn unimpeded across siberia as they have since may after getting an unusually early start to the fire season a thick blanket of smoke has turned the sky a milky gray in siberia s cities with some smoke making it across the pacific into alaska and canada s hudson bay in fact according to mark parrington senior scientist and wildfire expert at the european union s copernicus atmosphere monitoring service siberian wildfire smoke has been seen around the world as it hitches a ride on upper air winds to track wildfires and estimate their emissions of planet warming carbon dioxide black carbon and more parrington uses satellite instruments to detect heat signals all over the world he and his colleagues then use the temperature of the signals to arrive at an estimate of the energy emitted by each fire by making the assumption that a particular amount of biomass plants grasses and trees for example is needed to burn at that temperature this measure of the rate of radiant heat output from a fire is known as radiatiative power which can then be translated into estimated emissions based on data stretching back to when the satellite sensors began recording reliable data parrington says arctic fires released more carbon dioxide in june and july this year than during any complete fire season before that this is an especially noteworthy milestone since itself had been a record breaker for arctic wildfires this year some of the arctic fires were burning so far north that they were spotted bordering sea ice cover looking at carbon emissions from fires in the arctic circle parrington says is already the top year even when the jan to aug period is considered vs the full days for each of the other years last year had set a record for such emissions with megatons of carbon dioxide emitted by arctic fires but has eclipsed it so far with about megaton through aug parrington said arctic wildfire emissions rose significantly from june into july particularly in the northern russia sakha republic a pattern also observed last year it s an indicator that something s changed in the environment there he said of the fire activity of the past two summers jessica mccarty a wildfire expert at miami university of ohio with experience working in the siberian arctic said parrington s emissions estimates are probably underestimates since satellites don t detect the heat signatures from arctic peat fires such blazes smolder without open flames above the surface consuming ancient organic matter and freeing up planet warming gases such as methane and carbon dioxide that had been locked away this along with permafrost melt acts to speed up global warming as part of a self reinforcing cycle according to mccarty she and her colleagues are unable to access siberia this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic so there s a greater dependence on satellite estimates now she says she has explored areas in the transition zone between the tundra and arctic taiga which has coniferous forests and has seen burned areas that never showed up on satellites she s hoping to get to the region next year to conduct surveys that could shed more light on what has been burning given the differing global warming implications of smoldering peat compared to burning vegetation mccarty has searched through the scientific literature from arctic nations as part of a report she is co authoring for the arctic council this is the type of fire event that would be described by these worst case modeling scenarios that were supposed to occur mid century she said adding that we may be years early in seeing such fire impacts which would require a reevaluation of how the arctic is responding to global warming for next year she ll be examining when the fire season starts where it begins what types of landscapes burn and what the ignition sources are once you log a few extreme fire seasons she says the extreme becomes the norm known to fire researchers as a fire regime if seven out of years are extreme years that s a fire regime mccarty said she said a review of scientific literature from russia and other arctic nations shows that siberian fires typically subside in mid to late august when the first snows arrive in the far north but that assumption may need to be revisited too if any fires this year continue into september she said i ll be really shocked i don t know that i ll have words that are ready to be published record warm year leads to extensive fires the fires were touched off by an unusually hot year to date which has helped dry out the soils and melt snow cover unusually early in the spring for example temperatures have hit record levels even in the arctic north of degrees north latitude a reading of degrees celsius on june was probably the hottest temperature on record in the arctic it was recorded in verkhoyansk about miles east of moscow on june the people who live in siberia and other arctic regions are used to variable weather in verkhoyansk for example temperatures can drop to minus degrees in the winter and climb into the s during the summer yet the persistent warmth so far this year has stood out to climate researchers an oil spill in russia s arctic exposes risks for moscow s far north plans what is incredibly unusual is the persistence of the warm signal in siberia said samantha burgess deputy director of the copernicus climate change service in an interview she said the warmth has had significant implications for the region ranging from clearing out sea ice north of siberia unusually early in the summer melt season to contributing to permafrost melt that led to a major oil spill in norilsk russia burgess said the temperature spike in siberia this summer heralds events to come not only there but in other parts of the arctic as well as the region warms at about three times the rate of the rest of the world she said the siberian warm streak is likely to occur again and likely to show up in other parts of the arctic it s really taken people by surprise how quickly these changes have taken place in the arctic burgess said siberian heat streak and arctic temperature record virtually impossible without global warming study says the arctic as a whole has had record warm temperatures from may through july as measured in the lower atmosphere much of siberia experienced an exceptionally mild winter followed by a warmer than average spring and it has been among the most unusually warm regions of the world during the summer as well during may parts of siberia had an average monthly temperature that was a staggering degrees fahrenheit celsius above average for the month according to the copernicus climate change service the unusually mild weather has continued through august so far as an area of high pressure or heat dome has been parked over the siberian arctic fires and ice the summer fire and melt season hasn t just featured an unusual surge in fires and their harmful emissions it is also bringing dramatic declines in sea ice and in one prominent case long lasting ice attached to land arctic sea ice extent had been on course to break a record for the lowest extent on record this september eclipsing the previous record set in however ice loss rates have slowed since july says walt meier a senior scientist at the national snow and ice data center and it s unlikely the record will be broken this year the reason for the melt slowdown is persistent ice cover north and northwest of alaska whereas on the other side of the arctic sea ice emptied out early and water temperatures climbed across the laptev and east siberian seas meier says warm ocean waters in other parts of the arctic could continue melting ice throughout the month despite the weakening energy from the sun as fall approaches sea ice typically reaches its minimum extent in early to mid september a recent study using a computer model found that the arctic could be seasonally ice free by though other studies put the ice free date later than that in any case sea ice decline continues even if each year does not hit a record low with unusually warm conditions settling over northern canada a substantial portion of the remaining sections of the milne ice shelf canada s last remaining intact ice shelf broke off ellesmere island nunavut between july and july according to the canadian ice service and newly released satellite photos from planet labs the ice shelf a floating tongue of ice attached to glacier that rests on bedrock was vulnerable to melting from mild air temperatures above and relatively mild ocean temperatures below similar dynamics are playing out in greenland and antarctica where massive glaciers have been destabilized by the disintegration of their ice shelves which act as doorstops that prevent inland ice from sliding into the sea where it would dramatically raise sea levels before the breakup of the canadian shelf into large icebergs it was about the size of d c the associated press has reported

1,my last daily  post when i was years old my mother died my dad fell floors off a building smashing both legs and went into the nuthouse for a while my dad then married a woman with brothers who spent the next several years sexually abusing me and my sister i never saw my father much as a child i never told him the truth out of fear and shame until his last days i knew doing so would kill him by the time i was yrs i became homeless again after my girlfriend left me and bore a son who was adopted by the time i was yrs i was homeless again after my girlfriend left me and my nd son was born while on the streets i became a homeless newspaper publisher i hooked up with a street nurse witch and lived happily ever after the end the end didn t end there my newspaper publishing empire crumbled and i got work as a handyman for lakeside cottagers a few years ago i found out my st son had died at yrs old the adjustment from king of the world to humble servant was tough for me i needed more so i came to  that was about a year ago being years old i noticed the younger people needed their asses kicked for being arrogantly techno optimistic to hit them hard i wrote my first major post here this is it but i recently slipped back into my habit of smoking a joint and reading the news at am with a cup of coffee i post so many links here that i have to remind myself to read the good ones so i m leaving the comfortable  woods and drifting off into the animal grasslands to develop my mind most people here now accept  the resistance has crumbled hell i may even have slipped into the delusion of self importance lard knows my ego never d the resistance to pizzagate is strong and i feel i m needed there good day and goodbye naturally i can t leave without offending someone so to you i leave this p s monica petersen the young woman in charge of human trafficking in washington was killed before the election while officially investigating the clinton connection to a pedophilia ring in haiti it s called a suicide with no body it s highly likely you didn t know this because of media collusion the nyt is owned by a telecom don in mexico he s the riches guy in the world and connected to mexico s south east cartel hillary clinton s brother won a sweetheart gold mine lease in haiti that uses human trafficked labor in substandard conditions gold black slaves this is how you rape a whole country the kids are just a sideline pedophilia is pandemic now thanks to the dark web and child abductions are higher than average in the washington area when clinton pal laura silsby was caught smuggling orphans who had parents she claimed to be opening an orphanage in the dominican republic but no record of it exists the guy they sent to defend her has an interpol pedophilia record the first thing clinton did on her arrival in haiti was to get silsby off the hook clinton can only get away with this because of media collusion just as environmental activists die so too do pedophilia activists within weeks of tweet shaming podesta accusing him of being a pedophilia operative and within a day of him dying of a heart attack andrew breibart predicted his murder by heart attack in a tweet
1,can we prevent  with a closer look at the human brain hello everyone i am here to ask for some help regarding the work of iain mcgilchrist i am making a post as i believe his ideas are of profound importance to our modern world and i think many of the themes of his work fit well with that of this subreddit in fact i believe they could help us understand the psychological elements that could be leading us towards  and may provide answers regarding how we can make a change before it is too late i would appreciate any and all thoughts feedback criticism of his hypothesis as i believe it has the potential to make a substantial difference to our world and our future i do want to say that i am not affiliated with him economically or otherwise but that his ideas really do speak to me on a substantive level and i hope they do for you as well mcgilchrist s central thesis please forgive my butchering of a summary as i did not want this post to be longer relates to the two hemispheres of the human brain he asks the question as to why an organ which has the sole purpose of making connections is divided into two and believes this design relates to our competing needs and the two foms of attention we use to meet those needs for example imagine a wild animal is searching for food in order for it to separate seed from pebble or to capture prey it must have a focused precise narrow form of attention to be successful but if all of its attention is devoted to getting lunch it will very soon become someone else s this is because it must simultaneously have an open attention as wide as possible it must have an awareness for everything else that exists in its periphery it must be aware of other entities be they friends mates or foes evidence demonstrates in animals that it is the left hemisphere that is largely responsible for the focused attention necessary to gather food and it is the right hemisphere which we need to have a broad awareness of everything else in short the left hemisphere focuses on a single part while the right takes into account the bigger picture the whole of experience mcgilchrist believes these two forms of attention in fact create two different versions of the world on one hand we have the context or the world of me just me and my needs an individual competing with other individuals my ability to peck that seed chase that rabbit or grab that fruit i need to use or to manipulate the world for my ends it is the left hemisphere s narrow form of attention which we need to do this to focus on a single thing on the other hand i also need to see myself in the broader context of the world at large in relation to other beings around me i need to see myself as a member of my social group to see potential allies mates and enemies here i could feel myself to be connected to something much bigger than myself the flight or flock with which i roam the pack with which i hunt the mate and offspring i must also feed and take care of and everything else in my purview for this a broad open attention to whatever exists is necessary and this is provided by the right hemisphere these two forms of attention are blended together so seamlessly that they are imperceptible mcgilchrist goes further and argues that these two hemispheres have very different dispositions towards the world and its inhabitants and i ve tried to summarize the key differences here we utilise the right hemisphere in order to understand as provided by its broad open form of attention it plays a vital role in our capacity to empathise with one another to bond socially to read human faces understand gesture and other forms of implicit communication such as tone of voice it appreciates uniqueness rather than general categories it is the right hemisphere that has a preference for the living for the natural world which it has a relationship with the left hemisphere is primarily involved in manpulation we grasp things with our right hand connected to our left hemisphere we use it to make tools to categorize in most people it is where language is stored and language in many ways gives us tremendous power the left hemisphere allows us to make and operate machinery and without it even hammering a nail can be impossible the key purpose of the right hemisphere is connection while the left s is to manipulate and have power over its surroundings while both hemispheres are vital to our survival mcgilchrist argues that the left hemisphere s version of reality has become predominant in our modern world leading to a world lacking in empathy mechanically oriented and obsessed with control all the while the right hemisphere s capacity for empathy trust compassion and attraction to the natural world have been inhibited when we look at the real world events today be it warfare the destruction of the natural world the need for total power and control all of which could lead to the  of our civilizations i cannot help but feel that all of these are strongly linked with the hypothesis mcgilchrist provides mcgilchrist also believes that if we address this imbalance we could have the opportunity to create a better world one where the values of the right hemispheres are allowed to be primary and i believe this could help us immensely with the many issues we face as a society and as a species the reason why i am sharing this information is because it is something that i deeply believe in i ve looked at the evidence and i m convinced and it has given me hope that if people work together we can solve this as a child i remember distinctly the horror i felt seeing pictures of the holocaust seeing faces just like mine many younger than mine human beings who had done nothing to deserve the experimentation torture and murder that ocurred with such virulence that emotion only compounded with the more i learned be it nanking hiroshima or the modern day uncountable cruelties that occur how could this have happened and why does it continue to occur but as worn down as these events made me it was seeing the opposite that gave me some hope learning about for instance the renaissance period of romanticism the civil rights movement the s peace movement it seemed as if these events these moments in time represented two very different ways of viewing the world of existing even in one there is a clear lack of compassion and human connection human beings in a way become objectified reduced to automatons to be utilised exploited in whatever way is deemed fit there is an obsession with utility material goods industrial and technological advancement the primary purpose becomes power for its own sake this is contrasted starkly by the other events i referred to in these periods it is not power that is the motive it seems but human connection there is an understanding of the fundamental qualities that humans share regardless of group there is a realization that this individual infront of me is a human being just like myself and i should treat them in the way that i would be treated when i see photos of white and black people in the civil rights movement this is what i see for instance in many ways i think these contrasting events indicate which hemisphere is primary at any point in time by no means am i suggesting that these events can be entirely explained by differences in the hemispheres but i do think that there could be a strong link mcgilchrist argues that although there have been periods throughout history where both hemispheres flourished together he believes that we have moved more and more to the world of the left more than anything i want to see a world in which human beings are able to live together peacefully where we do not have to worry about environmental devastation or warfare and i believe that is the right hemisphere s abilities that will allow us to do that if anyone is interested in looking into this further ive listed two links below a ten minute animation and a half an hour talk as i said previously any feedback is greatly appreciated rsa animate the divided brain the divided brain and the western world

1,the challenges we face my take on the state of the usa and the planet these are the musings of a year old man sick at home and in bed take them with a grain of salt add your feedback add your criticism as needed this will be broken up into main categories social economic political and environmental feel free to mention additional categories if you feel i have left one out let s get started social with the invention of the smartphone the fabric of our social sphere has fundamentally been changed to humanity s detriment why so negative you might ask surely social media has had some positive impacts the basis for every element of social interaction and media all the way from political discourse information dissemination and political propaganda to intimate human relationships is now channeled and manipulated by private institutions that permanently tie our interactions to advertising and marketing our very understanding of objective reality and truth is in question all information we are exposed to is exposed to us at a granular level with the explicit intent to manipulate our opinions to favor the ruling classes these private institutions profit from our engagement the most effective emotion to ensure engagement to a platform is outrage therefore the current state of unanimous outrage at every level and every corner of society is working as intended and will obviously continue to occur while bullets start flying it is a feedback loop of social destruction that is doomed to breed violence and chaos in the populace the social element is tied to all other categories economic the american dream of home ownership is no longer a viable option for young people in the united states as financial institutions gobble up houses to establish rental properties the rate of production of new homes is no where near demand homes are selling many tens of thousands over their listed price and there is no end in sight the housing shortage is predicted to continue throughout the s by several economists healthcare continues to balloon in cost to absolutely absurd levels as everyone knows insurance feels like a complete scam or highway robbery with hundreds of dollars a month only providing high deductible plans that require out of pocket before the insurance even does anything our healthcare system is about to implode again from covid cases overwhelming icus which will undoubtedly be passed on to us childcare is a second rent or mortgage which begs the question of why work at all if your labor and care for your own child is so economically valuable this line of thought about childcare can be followed to other sectors too if being a responsible working and contributing member of society can no longer provide you housing and healthcare then why contribute society is beginning to fail to uphold it s end of the bargain all of this of course should rationally mean that the older generations are terrified for their children at the reality that all the opportunities they were afforded are no longer viable for their kids and grandkids and the america they grew up loving has been stolen from their family by the ruling classes surprise nope our parents are too busy being pissed off about hunter biden because of the forces of social  previously mentioned this category can go on forever poverty homelessness the fucking ridiculous stock market right now but moving on political due to factors in social  a significant swath of the usa genuinely believes in their hearts that donald trump won the election in and are im patiently waiting his triumphant return to office in the problem is he s going to lose again and this time around he s had practice people are infinitely angrier this is a recipe for disaster that we should all be able to see a mile away i am of the opinion that the usa will undergo significant and widespread political violence before during and after the presidential election due to the accusations being made by the gop there is a genuine possibility that this election will be the last election the usa has under the current paradigm that is republican anger will be so great that the system is no longer viable to continue i question whether or not the usa can continue to exist in this political state while one half of the government contends that the other is cheating this can serve as a validation for the republicans to cheat themselves and have public support for doing so why play fair if your voting base would support you openly committing fraud there s a genuine incentive to break the whole fucking foundation of american elections regarding the root of this problem in our democracy the people bear the political power through our elections the opinions of the populace dictate who our leaders will be due to technology generating our social  the opinions of the populace have never been so easily malleable and dynamic as they are today however our constitutional republic is predicated on and educated and informed electorate by the very definition the our founding fathers laid down our current political and social state in the us is not compatible with democracy we do not have an educated and informed electorate we have a mass manipulated malleable and controllable electorate that is actively contorted to fit the opinions that are convenient to the ruling classes environmental i am preaching to the choir on this one we re fucked we have years left of proven oil reserves but a significant portion of that is unrecoverable there will not be a suitable replacement for oil think about our supply chains that bring food to the people diesel tractors diesel combines diesel trains diesel cargo ships diesel cranes fucking everything is diesel the lifeblood of our entire system is oil and we have absolutely no idea what we are going to do when it s gone and it s not even a supply issue we will have to reduce our consumption of oil long before then but we can t even manage to do that of course looping back in the social  element most of the people in this country don t even believe in climate change because they re too caught up in their political outrage feedback loops this post was brought to you by the flu the flu at least it s not covid
1,coping how to improve your mental health in the face of  some techniques and activities to try hello  sucks if you aren t already directly experiencing its consequences then you re at least learning about it and its probably taking a toll on your mental health getting angry sad and or down about the news is natural nobody should doubt that and nobody should be gaslighted for periods of negativity at  we are here to talk freely and reflect on humanity s awful destruction of nature however difficult circumstances and suffering are a perpetual fact of life  or not thoughts of death suffering of yourself and other people may well be hovering in the back your mind and weighing you down yup but this is just being confronted with something that was true anyway we re all going to die one day thats just how it is going about the business of living in as healthy way as possible while you are alive is important i made this thread to try and promote good mental health techniques and activities and hopefully get some good discussion going swell its an important message especially when life is hitting us with shit we shouldn t succumb totally to defeat and despair and that positively shifting perspective is genuinely doable for all us but good vibes don t mean anything on their own people need solid pathways by which to improve having personally suffered bad mental health im aware that it creates this impervious monolithic feeling that negativity is in charge and it is the only way or just the way things are if you feel like this then your mind is lying to you the various commenters of r  who are acceptant stoic full of dark humour or simply making the most of their daily lives they might seem a bit mad and deluded but they shine a light on an important fact we can take this in varyingly positive and acceptant ways all consuming negativity is not a fact but does have something to do with perspective bad mental health makes us feel that our emotions thought patterns and the reality they create are totally fixed when in reality they aren t consider improving your mental health as a valuable project and a scientific one too habitual negativity and depression is of no use to yourself or to the people around you we consider improving the body in a rational scientific project kind of way do a exercise every week eat b make sure i achieve c we don t necessarily treat mental health the same way but we really should im going into a bit of depth about two processes that can improve your thinking its not an exhaustive list and then some good activities to do the message is really to give them a go and i hope it reaches out to some people who think nothing can change my down ness why bother and these techniques aren t for me i should say very clearly i m not a doctor and this isn t a substitute for professional medical advice contacting your doctor is an important thing to do with regard to mental health i ll finish this intro with a sober note and say our lives are materially difficult in various ways and working on your thinking doesn t immediately change that there isnt a cure for being poor working a bad job or experiencing a flood or heatwave mind over matter has its limits think about how you can materially improve your conditions but also consider if an improved perspective can help you persevere through those conditions you aren t alone in going through this cognitive behavioural therapy cbt is a method which involves identifying challenging and changing negative thought behaviour patterns it creates a framework to identify common negative thought sequences and cognitive biases be they anxious angering worrisome and or depressive and then use understanding and recognition of them to logically challenge them through challenging them a patient can make progress to think better and then eventually feel better its a process something like identify a particular negative situational reaction you have i get anxious at work crystallise that reaction into a thought i am anxious at work because i don t think im good enough to do my job identify the bias and illogicity this is a low self worth bias challenge the thought with logical ideas i have the correct qualifications to do my job and my boss says they are happy with me reinforce those ideas and set up a process to challenge the negativity when it arises when i tell myself i am not good enough at work i will combat it by reinforcing this is an example pulled from my hazy memory but you get the idea the cbt course i did was very logically laid out i didn t learn to reinvent the wheel but most of us rarely make the effort to logically challenge our negative thoughts it was a worthwhile thing to do if you feel like your negative thoughts and emotions are regularly getting the better of you and you don t have a grip in them i really recommend it at the very least you will probably gain a bit of understanding can this actually help with regard to  cbt does focus on examples of cognitive biases in situations that aren t that necessarily objectively tough because it targets people struggling with day to day life situations  is about facing worse and the worst well we can equally have negative biases about things which are genuinely bad by making them seem even worse having a grip on our demons is good no matter our life situation even moreso in tough times you could argue online materials just found this great website called live life to the full its made by accredited cbt practitioner and psychosocial psychiatry professor dr chris williams after registering and answering some basic mental health questions you get access to a course for free i answered that i have general low mood and anxiety so i have access to the anxiety low mood cbt course it looks like its paid to get access to multiple courses but one course is free this looks like a proper cbt course its a british site hopefully non brits aren t ip blocked from registering this powerpoint and lecture by dr jason satterfield with the university of california is a great introductory overview of cbt why cbt sets up the way it does to tackle negative thought processes it also touches more broadly on stress reduction techniques this video by dr todd grande who has a great channel on mental health is like a starting lesson in cbt it focuses on common cognitive distortions and illogicities so its the identify step of cbt this shorter video covers cbt techniques for anxiety and again is presented nicely and logically by mark tyrell his channel offers well reasoned critical and alternative takes on the modern clinical mental health system and current methods i can t find his credentials anywhere so thats a good reason to stay sceptical however if you watch his channel he does seem to be knowledgable and talking sense my personal take i like his content face to face professional cbt courses good news if you are british cbt is offered via the nhs that includes online courses so if an in person course isn t an option for whatever reason you should be able to do something online you need to contact your gp to be registered for one find help with stress anxiety and depression england only apologies to scotland wales and ni you will have to find your own equivalent pages for america all i could find were expensive paid courses with a quick search i found this list of institutions which offer cbt research what is available in your state maybe your health insurance covers cbt mindfulness meditation the reason i m making this post in the first place meditation is a group of techniques that first took hold in india and spread to the far east particularly under buddhism mindfulness more specifically refers to the practice of cultivating awareness and focus on the present moment through observation of present sensations through developing this concentration a practitioners mind becomes calmer clearer happier and more open mindfulness has changed my life so very much for the better the list of benefits coming up really do apply for me but also it helped me got in touch with why i became socially anxious in the first place in an extremely therapeutic way anyway only suckers believe something purely based on anecdotal evidence many studies have been done on meditation practitioners and the results are impressive studies show it helps tune out distractions and relieves pain it makes people happier it quietens the region of the brain associated with rumination and the day to day churn of thoughts it improves concentration it can even increase your grey matter and neural connections final link if you d rather not read all those articles papers this page has a summary and infographic for what s of meditation studies have found these studies were generally done with novices not experienced practitioners the buddhists and hippies had it right on this much to be in the present moment is an incredibly important skill in these times the past is full of regret if you re a moper like me and things you cannot change the future is uncertain and terrifying more focus on the now helps let those worries go and commit to what is actually happening in your day to day life we re faced with so many modern pressures in our brutal transactional egotistical society and they stress us out meditation promotes antidotal qualities level headedness and calmness less focus on distractions less triggering of the argumentative and indignant ego more happiness better sleep and other health benefits and yeah it also fucking lutely helps with  thoughts and  experience this world is working us up into a panicked angry frenzy remaining calm clear and focused in the face of it in the toughest moments is invaluable gt meditation is preparation for the worst day of your life sam harris the sceptic says if meditation just all chilling out and letting go shouldn t we be getting angry instead and working furiously to change things well the problems in the world and big and daunting and complex we need to be thinking calmly and clearly to make progress the meditative mind lets go of the things that can t be done and gravitates towards clearer thoughts of what actually can be done this post if it were to only help single person is something i can get done and staying up a night worrying about climate change would not not have helped that online materials there are a billion pages online about religion meditation philosophy meditation meditation types meditation schools lifestyle meditationpages lets keep it simple lots of good plain english evidence based youtube videos out there here s a ted talk on how mindfulness helps deal with everyday pressures onto instructional material r meditation wiki faq is a very informative guide with lots of good info and links apart from overemphasising the differences between types of meditation they aren t that different just pick one and get started its a very good page i ll write a simple mindfulness method in the comments below and some advice if you are anxious and or depressed i ve taught my anxious self and i m teaching someone with depression guided meditations are a great way to get started sam harris guided mindfulness explains it in plain english once you understand the technique you can practise on your own for example try putting a rain sounds video on and focusing for mins the choice is yours the headspace app is pretty damn popular and widely praised aswell as explanations and instruction its one of those apps that helps you to set goals and practise regularly with a timetable starts with a free trial but after that it costs be warned good for app heads it is important to be active in your meditation progress and to consider advice from multiple sources most people find progress bumpy and get stuck at times particularly likely if you suffer from bad mental health if that happens thats normal somewhere online there is probably a good description of the adjustments you need to make to keep progressing its a case of finding the advice that resonates with you i got crucial advice from browsing r meditation below the method in the comments i ll put some advice for anxious people and depressive people in person most cities probably have somebody running meditation classes somewhere bare in mind there is no qualification to run a meditation class each teacher has their own particular presentation of meditation and spiritual philosophy which may or may not chime with you you get a particular focused energy from doing meditation in a group the same way you work harder in an instructed group exercise class so thats plus there is a growing movement to bring mindfulness to schools and social projects and to integrate it with clinical mental health services see what is available locally it can t hurt to ask your doctor about it paid meditation retreats run by various groups are popular for middle class people lol start somewhere else though its a bit much to start with a week of solid meditation you might have heard heard of transcendental meditation tm is a group and a brand of meditation they have some celebrity proponents judging by the enthusiasm with which they promote it tm instruction is legitimate however they try to create a mystique around their particular process and charge huge sums of money for their retreats what they offer is no better than what you can do at home for free meditation doesn t and shouldn t require money to access forgive me for not giving an extensive list of links while group meditation provides lots of motivation and structure starting at home is viable to finish a few activities proven to improve mental health exercise not going to repeat the obvious it works its very proven to work do you need a min ted talk on its brain changing effects to be convinced eh give it a listen anyway its good but just to highlight one thing anyone who pushes themselves to their very limits will attest to the endorphins and great head clearing quality high intensity exercise has high intensity exercise is suggested to have particular benefits for depression mores than just medium light intensity work some people are adverse to high intensity work but they shouldn t be getting out in nature again this simple stuff but spending some time in the wild is really good for your mind we are wild animals by nature and we came from the jungle and savannah after all this study of adults showed the correlation between exposure to green spaces and less depression horticultural therapy gardening is now integrated as mental health therapy in the british nhs tip if you live in a city and not around much nature there will almost certainly be a community gardening project near you somewhere volunteering and community work i really dig this one in my mental health fog reading all the bad news online i felt really isolated and powerless and in the capitalist economy our jobs are largely soulless but necessary transactions of labour which we wouldnt chose to do otherwise cooperating with other people on a

1,interesting  related dream i had a brief vague dream that went a little like this i was privy to the conversation during st or subsequent contact with extra terrestrial intelligence world leaders were giving these advanced beings a summary of our planet and it s current situation this left their leaders in a state of utter dis belief are you telling me that you have s of private entities exploiting your planet s resources at their discretion with little to no involvement think about it our planet s varied resources can be looked at like a bank account air quality fossil fuel reserves soil for growing crops populations of ocean species water quality forests minerals the list is extensive imagine these are the equivalent to the amount in a bank account a massive joint account shared by bn people and countless other organisms no one is keeping track of the expenditures no one is keeping track of the income there is no planning at least not an exhaustive planetary scale plan or projections amp xb i have a feeling that advanced beings would be closely monitoring every aspect of their planet making sure levels are consistent and things are heading too much one direction or another instead we have people making decisions like oh china needs more soybeans guess we ll cut down some rainforest oh tuna is becoming scarce guess the price is going up amp xb what a mess we re a bunch of year olds running around this ball i could keep going but you get the idea
1,what i m really waiting for 
1,are humans delusional the question itself is leaning toward being serious rather then the fact its almost friday where i am i m beginning to think that possibly human beings if we had an outside judge would deem us to be insane this may stem from the fact that we never seem to have a set vocation purpose or function i am personally okay with this there is also the factor of holding onto beliefs that through proofs or later theories turn out to be wrong and then have unexpected side effects and consequences for the world it s also coupled with the completion of actions and making choices without any further understanding of what harm it might do to the environment or other people this seems to be fueled by further grandiosity and getting lost in our own inventions and imaginations that become real these can be ideologies or inventions in technology beliefs which only seem to accelerate our destruction and perhaps only accelerate  further possibly the day to day repetitive nature of existence and the need for habit is what makes everything become even crazier in the end it s a contradiction having the exact opposite effect then what humans intended with our need for rationalistic order building for example we seem to be obsessed with our thoughts and needing to understand the universe my understanding by observation is that other animals that humans clearly are may not have any of these thoughts and it may not even strike their mind as being important since all other animals have lived on the planet since organisms began millions of years ago a lot of them have come and gone and many of them probably haven t even been remembered so it seems that perhaps our obsessions and firm beliefs in things that are proven to be wrong even our language is made up by us and no one speaks this outside the universe that we may not be any closer then when we started because further investigation of knowledge may continue ad infinitum do you think humans are just delusional should we even care or have the purpose thoughts

1,post covid world since no one can deduce with accuracy what exactly will the post covid world look like the one thing i m certain about is that the virus is going to be the least of our worries once this is all said and done i m sure many of us with or w o a job feel the same way to some degree and are hoping for a return to pre normalcy but that type of thinking will not be beneficial to your survival although we wouldn t know how much time there is left before societal  specifically in the western world u s what skills and knowledge must be attained for self sufficiency and how can i go about learning to apply them with available online resources free or paid the only vague general topics that come to mind for me when considering researching on jstor and other scholarly sites are gardening sense of direction medicine hands on skills with tools hygiene cooking and sanitizing food however i personally have no clue where to start or what topic needs to be more specific i probably do know but i have yet to start and i feel like that s the trickiest part then there s everything else that you guys will suggest that i would ve never thought of the only traits of mine that i feel confident in is the ability to handle physical labor really well having a sense of direction of los angeles w o relying on my cellphone swimming knowing when to trust my gut feeling and having a reliable support system family to back me up if that counts lol amp xb note would looking at third world countries that had level travel advisories before the virus interrupted everything such as libya somalia sudan and etc be a good reference for what our society may come to look like in the worst case scenario i don t think any nightmare scenario will play out to the point where there s chaos everywhere in the u s or other first world countries but you honestly never know

1,shale oil the next subprime crisis just because i had to do the research for a rude uninformed poster elsewhere and because it s probably wasted on him or her here s a collection of articles positing that the crisis in shale production may lead to the next debt and financial market crisis keep in mind that the situation is getting chaotic and that chaotic conditions can end up in funny places however these articles point out some mechanisms that could cause another financial  and they re worth keeping an eye on from moneyweek the sliding oil price could be the next subprime crisis from bloomberg oaktree s marks says oil decline may ignite debt crisis wall street daily junk bond carnage bank of england financial stability review gt as us oil and gas exploration firms account for of outstanding debt in us high yield bond markets an increase in the preceived or realised credit risk in this sector could lead to sales by investors and potentially illiquidity in the broader high yield market the telegraph oil price slump to trigger new us debt default crisis as opec waits gt based on recent stress tests of subprime borrowers in the energy sector in the us produced by deutsche bank should the price of us crude fall by a further pc to per barrel it could result in up to a pc default rate among b and ccc rated high yield us borrowers in the industry west texas intermediate crude is currently trading at multi year lows of around per barrel down from per barrel in june gt a shock of that magnitude could be sufficient to trigger a broader high yield market default cycle if materialised warn deutsche strategists oleg melentyev and daniel sorid in their report the wall street journal falling oil prices could lead to massive junk bond defaults gt mr hamid says that the possible default rate is the upper limit over the next few years and that energy companies will take steps to avoid falling into bankruptcy including cutting spending and selling assets gt still even if companies make smart moves to cut costs with oil at per barrel or below for the next three years he estimates that default rates high yield bonds from the energy sector could still hover around to it would become a very dire scenario mr hamid said moneyweek this could be the start of subprime gt it s a story with many facets many of them genuinely wonderful cheap energy to revitalise the us economy cashflows from an economy that would then be able to repay interest on considerable us debt and to top it all an industry that would need investment funds to get it all going gt we re talking about massive new lines of credit aimed not at subprime homeowners but energy companies especially small and medium sized oilers ready willing and able to take other people s cash and invest it in all manner of high tech drilling projects gt the banks were only too willing to help and just as with subprime these loans were sold throughout the globe the atlantic expert predictions for the global economy in gt there are several major risks already emerging a jolt to the system in the form of falling oil prices at the end of has exposed weaknesses in sovereign debt like that of venezuela as well as the enormous number of energy companies that have relied heavily on the lowest rated junk bonds which make up percent of the market for subprime corporate lending standard amp poor s analyst diane vazza noted that the large debts held by oil and gas companies mean defaults are likely to increase in the coming year this spells trouble for the banks lending to those companies as well as for the rest of the economy since data from deutsche bank show that the energy sector accounts for one third of all capital expenditures in the s amp p the financial times a real danger to global financial system from oil price  gt there is a very important transmission mechanism that could ensure that problems in the energy sector reverberate across the global financial system credit derivatives gt the exposure of us insured banks to derivatives stood at tn at the end of june more specifically us banks had an exposure of tn to credit default swaps with around tn subinvestment grade about per cent of the us high yield market relates to energy companies with oil prices below per barrel per cent of us subinvestment grade energy companies could end up in restructuring or default this means that banks could have to pay out on more than bn of credit default swaps gt however that is a conservative estimate if defaults from the energy sector spread out more widely across the high yield bond markets payouts on credit default swaps could be much higher there are also other derivative products such as structured notes that have been sold by banks to investors that are related to the oil price and could cause large losses for investors the guardian five issues that will make or break the world economy in gt greetham says the plunging oil price could prompt credit stress this would affect governments such as russia venezuela and iran that can only balance their books if the oil price is at a barrel or more and it would affect the shale gas sector in the us where much of the investment has been financed by high yielding but risky junk bonds as the bank of england points out in its recent financial stability review as us oil and gas exploration firms account for of outstanding debt in us high yield bond markets an increase in the preceived or realised credit risk in this sector could lead to sales by investors and potentially illiquidity in the broader high yield market in other words shale could be the next sub prime

1,choose which ship you go down in i have always kept abreast of world news politics and culture etc but have had more time recently now i will be the first to admit that if you are given more time to do something you will learn things you didn t know before but have always been there but i am sure that this is not the case with our current state of society and we are currently experiencing a rapid increase in our rate of  with the uk even the name contradicts leaving the eu and how divisive the whole process and situation has proven to be side note no uk prime minister wants to be remembered as the one that broke up the union david cameron will now forever be known as the one that started it with boris johnson as the buffoon that finally sunk the ship i hate the term brexit it trivialised a small mindedness that fosters isolationism forget the politics because i am sick of the argument i m infuriated with having to justify inclusion diversity opportunity and community as a good thing and frankly it s too late we got what we ordered and now we have to eat the shit we are served with the gop clearly and obviously throwing away all ideas of democracy and behaving purely partisan in an obvious desire to do nothing other than remain in power i have watched every single day of televised house committee investigation and senate trial so far i have watched cnn fox cspan nbc bbc msnbc to make sure i am seeing as many sides as possible and i am disgusted by how obviously partisan the process has been from both sides anyone with an ounce of decency even those that are uncomfortable with it and try to stifle it can see that donald j trump is an abomination of a man let alone president of the united states of america don t use potus don t just say president because he s the fucking president of the united states of america and it should be said that way to convey the gravity of the position a failed celebrity business man a chewing gum comic strip sir alan sugar he s no better who has bankrupt a casino how the fuck do you manage that if you are corrupt and don t give a shit that s how a man that has fought tooth and nail to hide his financial records because they will show how his real estate sham is funded by russia therefore indebting him to russian mobsters every other president of the united states of america has handed them over freely everything that man has done to young but once promising nation is truly depressing the paris agreement lifting restrictions for waste disposal in areas of wetland and watercourses signing of on the deforestation and development of huge swathes of american forest building a fucking wall the gop will forever be known now as a party of scared and vain power mongers that fell in line and created the new nazi party just because they were so protective of their own precious wealth status and power seriously read up on how and why the german nazi party became so big and how normal people joined to stay safe and rebuild a great nation with coronavirus looking the the next plage of the s meaning physical land borders will be setup brining with it the fear and prejudice that follows its too early to say how bad it will be but flu like virus world epidemics have proven to be devastatingly deadly in the past not so didtant past either with the rise of disinformation stochastic terrorism anti sentiment that drives belief structures and cultures like flat earth and antivaxx really just fucking fucks sake people get a grip your desire to belong to something that you can claim knowledge power and security in contradicts your intention of an alternative anti culture create your own tribe to belong and protect yourself from tribes because tribes are bad and educate with fake truths can t you see the absurd ness of it all if the hypocrisy doesn t mean we disappear up the collective arsehole of our consciousness then the apathy about it all will mean it happens with a big fat meh anyway these are just the biggest examples of what is going on right now without mentioning every country in protest having an uprising experiencing famine war or natural disaster with the seas becoming polluted and unbalanced in it acidity killing fundamental building block of our ecosystems somehow it s ok to be a cunt as long as you openly admit to being a cunt we are the cancer that is eating this planet if you look at our species and had to compare us to another i can only compare us to locusts viruses that alien race that s moves from planet to planet harvesting its resources and destroying everything along the way

1, is an existential crisis first off thank you all for being accepting of my recent acceptance of our current reality this process has highlighted things i m been feeling and wanting to do for a long time and it has also highlighted for me the why a special thanks to u oldagecynicism who immediately saw me struggling and offered me personal help  is an existential crisis which is the very reason  is happening imho one can blame it on greed ignorance capitalism etc whatever piece of the complex system of our society you want to pick personally i don t think the systems our ancestors picked to run society caused it i don t think that is a fair label and don t plan to walk around with an eat the rich mentality i can t blame them for the inevitability of the breakdown of our complex system due to basic human nature the alternative systems they would have may have picked would have resulted in the same overshoot just at different times and to a different degree humanity is an existential crisis deep down as we ve developed the knowledge of mankind we ve always known most major religions have a beginning and an end long before we knew there were a beginning and an end outside of our own lifespans our attempted avoidance of that end for some of us and our kin forever growth we ve never been able to deal with morality hence my user name i ve always dealt with death differently than most everyone around me the biggest challenge i personally face right now is existential i m living peak human white male top income earning in tech relative job security starting a company kids in private christain school waste and overshoot everywhere in how we live my kids are twice as wasteful and spoiled as i was when i was a kid and i grew up in the middle upper class in the s as my true knowledge of humanity has grown something i ve had an initiate longing to understand i ve started calling for a simpler life as deep down i have known about  for a while i m a prepper and love the one second after series i ve been wanting to move out of the rich atl suburban city i live in leave many of the wealthy and successful people i associate with because i know they won t accept it and move out to the county to get closer to god and or nature let s live how my forefathers should have i might be too late but at the end of the day i can say to myself i tried to start doing the right thing my wife family friends have always been able to shoot it down my ideas of a simpler life and i ve never had the true resolve to take action in fact we are constantly going in the opposite direction similar to how humanity has treated  it is existential and people don t want to face it and in fact over index in the opposite direction now i know for certain i cringe at the terms but i ve taken the red pill and i m woke i ve told my wife it s over we are moving she says she can t handle it and would rather divorce than accept and move even though it would still change our current lifestyle she thinks i m crazy and knows our deep network of friends we care about will think i m crazy she thinks i ve turned into the extremist i ve always been lambasting against she is worried about what society will think i want them to see what we are doing i d love for these titans of my local society and professional network to tell me i m wrong and prove it to me in their attempt to save someone they love from succumbing to the metal delusions clearly brought on from covid isolation during this conversation and point blank asked her if she thinks i need to be in a mental hospital and she couldn t answer me with a straight face however i can no longer live in denial and be a hypocrite especially with my kids i can t imagine continuing to live this lie when i start to broach the idea of moving with my oldest daughter she said she wants a bigger house i can t let them be unprepared in the future and be resentful of me for continuing to live a lie when i know the truth i need to be there for them as they come to this realization and give them the tools to live a happy and fulfilling life during  while being in a position to help out humanity reinvent itself post  people with families fully living the peak st world lifestyle how did you adjust once you knew is it better to keep living your current life with an it is what it is attitude or do you feel destined to start living the life you know we should be living closer to the world that is coming p s before you experienced regulars label this post as something i e crypto fascist i don t know if what i m typing falls under some label this community doesn t like i m just expressing the best way i know how the existential crisis i m going through looking for words of wisdom encouragement advice edit this is why the phone and the printed press were evil inventions not blowing up my lifestyle but living closer to earth my kids are still going to eat berries in their smoothies at lunch also i ve been able to be a digital nomad traveled all over for work for years and choose to live in middle america we could easily walk bike to school play store and grow a sustainable garden i ain t worried about the

1,in the face of catastrophic climate change we should be deregulating the economy one thing about the climate change debate that has always irked me is this unbridled optimism and lack of inherent grip on reality from the left i ve heard time and time again how we need to regulate industry increase carbon taxes create big government systems to change behavior and slow down climate change i m an economics major and from my perspective we ve never even come close as a society to having the individual and collective will to do what would be necessary to save mother earth we ve even seen that in the last few years as any attempt at reversing the damage has been completely ineffective the idea that we will act now in the face of imminent societal  is ridiculous it s not to say the motivations weren t well intended but they were always divorced from reality in my opinion our capitalistic and consumerism society is hellbent on getting more for less and we allow very little to disrupt that paradigm amp xb however i am still optimistic in sam harris s ted talk he talks about how if we can simply maintain what we have going here for long enough we will create a general artificial intelligence that can improve itself once we have that he claims something like years of human knowledge will be learned by this thing in the first ten days due to exponential computing power im not convinced an ai would even be sympathetic to our cause but in my opinion it s our only shot this ai should be able to provide us with very detailed answers to insanely complex and up to now unsolvable problems i put climate change on that list i don t know how it would work exactly but i think it s our one shot at salvation amp xb to get to general ai faster we need an explosion of economic growth and investment we need freed up capital reduced taxes and unbridled regulations to allow our tech companies to innovate freely and as quickly as possible we need to be dumping our tax dollars into the economy and ensuring no holds barred innovation amp xb it s a race against time the negative side effects from this will be challenging to fix and who knows if the damage from something like this would bring us to our doomsday before we could be saved by ai but it s coming anyways so why not be realistic and give it our best shot to me this is an inherently better model than the continued political slog to try and reduce emissions by a inconsequential percentage being fought tooth and nail by lobbyists and corporate dollars every step of the way

1,why the ipcc report is worse than it appears there are two different predictions about the climate and it seems important to keep them separate there s the models for warming which show how much we are going to warm in the future based on various scenarios but then there s the whole science of trying to predict what real world effects will happen when at which degrees do we see various weather events disasters tipping points etc we are at or degrees right now we will be flirting in a decade guaranteed but you have to follow the real world events and what the experts are saying who are observing things in the field right now the glaciers are melting at levels that experts thought would be at higher levels of warming the arctic is melting at levels that should be happening at higher levels of warming the droughts floods heatwaves and record highs just read the quotes from the actual scientists who study these things for a living the quotes have been endless we didn t expect this for years the permafrost is melting at rates that the experts said wouldn t happen for years gt scientists have been shocked that the warm weather conducive to permafrost thawing is occurring roughly years ahead of model projections the ccag warning states it also points out that the arctic could lose percent of its permafrost by the moscow times reports this is not an isolated thing this is happening across all measures it s a running joke on this sub but of people are completely unaware of this trend bottom line we are all indebted to the scientists doing the research on this stuff but the ipcc summary media event and when exactly we hit or or is far less important than the fact that is probably going to look more like what scientists said would look like the real s are going look feel like the s they predicted if we take the scientists at their word now and don t wait years for a summary of it that alone is enough to fuck over modern global civilization but it seems more likely than ever that all the big baddies amoc boe permafrost amazon  etc that serious scientists say would happen late in the century are going to happen in the first half i e next years
1,reddit how do you deal with those in denial of the global economic energy crisis i ve encountered a number of people who when confronted with the facts concerning the current state of global affairs take a blissfully ignorant view of the problems we face just this evening i was told i should just live life and be happy while i embrace this attitude as much as possible in my life that does not mean i support remaining completely ignorant of the world around me i fully understand the desire of most people to simply ignore these problems especially at a time when the full effect of such a crisis has not been felt by them on a personal level the problems do however exist and are felt by millions of people across the globe already and they will be felt by most if not all eventually remaining in denial of this fact only furthers our unpreparedness for the problems we will all eventually face and puts us in an even more dangerous position prolonging the inevitable is after all only prolonging the inevitable it seems to me that the only way to truly deal with this crisis the best we can that is is to work together on personal local and regional levels to find practical solutions to very real problems my question to you fine redditors is what is the best way to go about educating those who are ignorant of the situation and also how do you cope with those who are aware of the problem yet refuse to deal with it for the sake of their own temporary comfort

1,parents of young kids don t believe in climate other forms of  because they psychologically cannot handle the truth show me a parent of a young child and i ll show you someone with childlike belief in our ability to innovate our way out of climate change biodiversity loss and pollution in general there is something innate psychologically about having a child that makes the parent believe a brighter future is possible despite the mountains of evidence to the contrary reinhold niebuhr once said rationality belongs to the cool observer but because of the stupidity of the average man he follows not reason but faith and the naive faith requires necessary illusion and emotionally potent oversimplifications which are provided by the myth maker to keep ordinary person on course and i think that sums it up beautifully the world is dominated by those who have children and so the world is necessarily dominated by those who think things will keep getting better despite all the evidence that things are collapsing tell a parent about limits to growth and they will weasel their way out of having a conversation about it ask them what they think about climate change and they will say that the government is making good progress on it we are all being held hostage by those who for no good reason at all believe the next years will play out like the last

1,cmv i don t believe human society will  here are different aspects and scenarios of things that i think will happen i rather believe in societal evolution and unplanned change i m writing this to reassure people who have a negative view of the current world we all have bad thoughts so i wanted to make a list of the cheerful things that will happen in the future humans are not so dependent on their environment a rising temperature of c will stress humans and kill people in certain areas india south america some parts of africa but humans can migrate north and protect themselves from heat remove concrete go near trees or colder places humans are already able to adapt their food vertical farming works gmo are viable and food can grow up north too combining food supplement mineral vitamins with basic food like wheat and veggies with spices is healthy and enough and can feed everyone there are a lot of technologies and solution to protect humans from nature that s how humans exited the food chain and it s false to say we are dependent on nature the last centuries are a great proof of this plastics will not kill the oceans there is too much ocean and there won t be enough plastics the earth is gigantic even though humans will have a tough time adapting their consumption and comfort it s mostly the baby boomers who are problematic young people are much more able and willing to adapt and they progressively will replace the old it is highly unlikely that civil war or world war will happen the world remembers ww and ww and everybody knows war is not an answer gaz powered vehicles can be replaced by a combination of electric trains the network exists bicycle mini train and muscular transports even though there might be social unrest caused by an inability to adapt it is unlikely that this can lead to enough violence most human aspire for peace cooperation and benevolence domination does not prevail in evolution migrations will happen but we all see that most people want to organize help people in need and most people will feel better by lending a hand people will be able to thrive with an increase of unemployment unemployment can lead to a happier life if people are more social and if work is not mandatory for socialization and moneyed social integration thanks for reading this list i hope it was useful to you

1,why isn t the possibility inflation or even worse hyperinflation more talked about in developed nations ie eu nations usa auz this one might be trying to beat a dead horse and people have been calling for inflation since but why aren t people media or politicians slightly worried about inflation or hyperinflation if they lose control of the currency this might be a simplistic view of things but is it not concerning that many central banks around the world are printing and issuing trillions of dollars of stimulus corporate loans are propping up zombie companies throughout na and bond rates are going near or hovering into the negative territory it seems to me like we current central banks are playing very fast and loose with the social currency of trust if or when that seems to snap we might see a massive revaluing of dollars am i crazy or why is this not on everyone else s radars i ve started to here some whispers of it by some macro thinkers and a bit on fintiwtter but mainstream its nowhere remotely discussed
1,some advice from my granny on the impending  fruit trees cool subreddit guys i just discovered it today a while ago i asked my granny whose family survived at subsistence level in rural wv during the great depression if she had any advice for the potential  her answer was fruit trees apples pears and plums she said you have to do the variety because if the apples get killed in the frost you still have pears that come out later and plums come out later still so you re protecting yourself against the frost or blight she said by the end of winter you are mighty sick of preserved fruit but it beats starving so if you have a piece of land plant now it takes some time to grow
1,so if you truly believe  is inevitable what next how should you manage your emotions this might be a long rant or it might not we ll see anyway as a consequence of having a lot of free time a computer with internet and basic intelligence it seems almost impossible to avoid environmental  in the future it might not be the most popular belief on this sub with all the talk of economics food and water but it s what i believe i figuratively can t see a possible future where we stop emitting because of future scares humans aren t made like that we re still dragging our feet despite new temperature records almost weekly no one thinks this is serious no one wants to change so obviously we ll just keep emitting until something big happens until a country near the equator a rich country will suffer such an extreme drought or flood or storm that tens of thousands of people die scientists will blame climate change but as you all know it ll already be too late what we re seeing now then is the product of what we did years ago no matter what we do be it build hundreds of nuclear plants ditch fossil fuels forever ditch cows and any greenhouse gas emitting process sigh we ll still suffer through hundreds of years of shit hitting the fan and probably the majority of humanity dying i personally don t want to be around for that not thinking of it now of course there s still too much enjoyment to have i think even if it s just that personal enjoyment no meaning to life no future just enjoyment faked happiness so i guess what i m asking is if it s even possible to avoid environmental  at this point will millions upon millions die no matter what we do or is there hope of capping off humanity at billion or so and still make it because as i ve said my interpretation is no just no but i m hoping somewhere that maybe i just want it to be pointless to care for whatever sick reason help me out i mean how would we manage our emotions if we knew earth was getting hit by a life ending meteor in years by certainty this is basically the exact same scenario

1,is school even worth it at this day and age i m about to finish my st semester at university i m m and recently i ve been wondering if school really is relevant for the future generation don t get me wrong we still need doctors teachers etc but as i see the world and how s it becoming i truly wonder if an school education really is worth it i m from denmark and i feel like all the global news is all about us other counties around the world is crumbling as well denmark is a very advanced welfare country it s rarely that i see homeless people here education is free and the government are paying for people for even going to school but despite all these good stuff i still wonder if school at the end of the day really is worth it we all know for a fact that the world we are living in right now ain t gonna look the same in just years i see rich people making business earning over six figures a year while someone who s been studying for years are only earning half of what the one who didn t study does i just need some perspective to this question what are your thoughts about it do you think school is necessary and relevant for our future if yes why if no what else should we attribute

1,everything that we have achieved thus far is not a result of humans being creative rather a sign of mischief you see we are the only species that bother every other plant and animal on this planet for man made wealth and illusion of happiness we exploit every corner of this planet this very behaviour closely resembles that of a parasite rather than a natural evolving species earth has never seen such mischief on such level we may have build mega cities achieved to connect billions of people across the globe that ended up in trillion of interaction but it is far from being creative i am afraid for me the lockdown the pandemic helped me to slow down and look at everything we know see and witness the poverty inequality natural degradation and increasing rate of animal extinction mental enslavement and division of society where nations practice nationalism and cynicism where neo liberalism is something of fear rather than security this virus is the beginning of the end extinction of certain type of behaviour due to rude awakening to the fundamental reality that mainstream society tried to turn our heads away with that i am talking about tv social media and fuelled consumerism to name a few to some the reality may look gloom grey boring or too scary other may take their life and shape it for better however the chances are greater than ever for someone to find no hope and surrender to ever growing depression so many people are unable to afford a house a place that we all call home where we feel safe cocooned so many people despite having two jobs are swimming in molasses of debt others breed extensions of their family by brining kids to the world again self centred behaviour that is rather outdated as it dates back to religious practices that were long buried by atheistic movement and scholars humanists plus millions just in united states alone follow a con man and unable to distinguish lie from truth it rings close to home as my brother is a victim of such claims such as pedophiles running the state is atrociously scary claims based on wishful thinking that lead to social distress that affect the objective reality and shape the brain of current and next generations in a way we just are starting to understand i am torn between being naively optimistic that good times are ahead neither in next decade nor next century though and between being realistically pessimistic corresponding to the real events that have had happened across the globe just in last some years an interesting study was presented in extinction conference moderated by lawrence krause together with leading scientists in fields of biology geology and technology based on science we know expected mammal rate extinctions background rate e msy extinction per years mammal species how many species actually went extinct extinctions in the last years mammal species today s extinction rate is times too high if we didn t save threatened species extinctions in the next years the extinction rate would be times too high after i picked my jaw off the floor based on the numbers we may as well heading towards life extinction event to summarize i don t know or to be more precise it is too soon to say if we indeed are heading towards mass species extinction what is sure is that if we don t stop being the parasite we are social tsunami that brings distress and  of some sort is inevitable my time is up thank you for being my prisoners of me trying to explain my coping with the current state of reality i am ready to be the hostage of your insight and opinion stay safe brothers and sisters
1,i am thinking about writing a book about  any suggestions i want to write a short book page about the looming  i want to make sure it tells the story about past  and events leading up to this  offers a good critique of current problems with society and lays out an ecologically culturally and financially sustainable model for a future civilization i would love some suggestions for how to structure the book plus any things i should add to the book the book also needs a clear message anti imperialist criticizes both current and past imperialism anti capitalist points out issues with our system of hyper capitalism and the negative impacts of globalization on the environment and certain communities pro nature environment supportive of preserving nature ecosystems and any society that minimizes its impact on the environment activity welcomes nature or embraces it anti war against war recognizes its destructive effects on nature communities anti consumerism criticizes mass consumerism investigates how mega corporations affect your physical and mental health pro self sufficiency endorses reduced reliance independence from large scale industrial civilization pro small community investigates the benefits of living in a small close community with family and friends and criticizes social isolation in the age of digital media other suggestions points i should make in the book are welcome what do you think
1,thanks poland not poland birth rates have increased why is this  worthy because overpopulation is a big contributing factor to environmental degradation east asia and the west were beacons of hope with our sub replacement birth rates poland is now reversing this phenomenon worst of all since poland is an industrialized nation every baby born here will have a much bigger carbon footprint over the course of his her life than a baby born in a rd world country poland experiencing baby boom report poland is experiencing a baby boom with estimates forecasting that up to children will be born by the end of the dziennik gazeta prawna daily has reported according to the paper the number of babies being born has been steadily growing since october last year hitting a seven year high in january the daily adds that the reason for the boom might be the government s programme which provides all families with two or more children with a state handout of pln usd eur a month per child the paper also says that the buoyant polish job market is an important factor in the growth in the number of births according to the paper the previous government s measures including that on extending parental leave significantly contributed to the baby boom in poland as well

1, pr or how we talk  with the unaware firstly i hope you didn t open this post hoping to get some handy tips on how to teach people about  because i m both asking about this and also pleading with the community to figure out how to chat  with our neighbors if we have any hope of adapting in time it s plainly obvious that ordinary people should be thinking of this rather than recycling harder we need to figure out how to talk about  without being dismissed as conspiracy theorists or fringe doomers i personally am accepting of the reality of the situation that we will be forced into less complex societal structures by the pressures surrounding us but part of me thinks people who have properly been able to adapt may find themselves living more fulfilling lives a long way down the line of course this makes it easier to explain  to people around me massive changes and an unrecognizable world in the future when you put it that way  is more intuitively understood because those massive changes are already underway and they are plainly obvious to anyone who doesn t live under a rock i guess my point is that framing  in an understandable way could end up saving lives through adaptation and resilience ahead of time but i m curious about your takes what is good  pr for you
1,lifespan of human civilization i learnt something today that made me think that maybe human civilization has a finite lifespan and inevitably has to end the something is called telomere a buffer that preserves our dna s ability to heal our body properly as we age our telomere gets shorter this makes it more and more likely to get terminal illness like cancer and heart disease everyone s telomere eventually wears out leading to death following on the concept of telomere as an indicator of remaining lifespan if we think the human civilization as a metaphor of a living being with finite lifespan it s easy to draw parallels the prehistoric times a baby learning to crawl ancient history a child learning the basics of adult life industrial era young adult that starts their career making good money modern era middle aged adult that reached the peak of their career but also suffering from ailments  era old adult that is in their twilight years where their former glory is nowhere to be found given this we can think that  is not only inevitable but it s also natural as all living beings eventually perish
1,energy vampires how we are being tricked in to giving our lives away as humans we only have so much time here on this earth it s important not to waste it by doing nothing and conversely it s good not to waste it by doing pointless things as well what things are worth doing what things are worth not doing there is a lot of energy being put in to fixing the world people care a lot they just care about the wrong things people ready to latch on to a movement that aligns with their goals are capable of being mislead by a powerful person who signals the right virtues in the right way are we really doing what we want with our time is this really who we are will the repercussions of our actions leave a good mark upon human culture will the echoes of our every action help the people around us what exactly are we doing in full and why are we truly expressing ourselves or are we just jumping from one culture or counter culture to another are these cultures organic or artificial there are so many traps in our modern world traps to change our spending habits our ideologies our feelings about the world to change our behavior and our voting patterns we are in an avalanche of words and opinions it s so easy to get swept away if you let your guard down we get exploited in this way just like the democratically voted anti corruption law passed in south dakota that was overturned by emergency measures put in to place ot overturn the law which i was quite upset about until i found it it s actually funded by billionaires anyway i got swept up in a story of revolution us but it was seeming as though it was just billionaires using a cool meme to push power grabbing legislation through and for hours i was completely fooled man i have this feeling we re going to be tricked in to thinking we did the revolution but it s all money driven it s like that pepsi ad but for real and we believe it damn it it seems like any time a revolution gets momentum and starts getting big then big money swoops in and corrupts it and yanks it in this corporatist direction while continuing to use the corpse everyone is attracted to like some weekend at bernie s situation how do we do a real revolution without getting corrupted it seems like the only solution is to withdraw entirely like hundreds of millions of people need to simply stop caring about the government basically so it becomes unimportant like some vestigial organ like kings and queens in modern europe but it has to be a very calculated withdrawal lest we get entangled in more traps looking at the world there will probably be a war coming that billionaires will drag us in to which they will profit from via their military industrial companies and at the same time nations around the world are seemingly being deteriorated intentionally and then these new globalists are going to have the solution to all this war and degradation ready and waiting for us and we ll all accept it because it simply will work better they ll see to make sure that s the case so we all get hooked on whatever system they re offering problem reaction solution aka the hegelian dialectic they will sell us on the new world order then over time it will become corrupted in the same way and then we re really screwed i almost don t know how else it can happen honestly unless people actually wake up lots of people

1,relocating to russia is not a solution to escape  gt throughout ages there were several highlight points at which it was very advantageous for a westerner to relocate into russia in few generations they usually settled at the top of the society as native organic element there is good swiss tv docu on ytube about a swiss small scale farmer not particularly young moving to russia from a dozen hectares of haphazardly scattered plots in ch to thousands hectares at one place while still maintaining down to earth attitudes rising kids and family i usually like worldofhanuman s words but this time he missed big russian history is full of accepting foreigners and kicking them out when they served their use flemish and dutch farmers were promised huge tracts of lands and came to russia they went to there drained the swamps and promptly lost their lands to the nobles a lot of western people mostly germans after all russian czars were germans went to russia where they did well during the th century when hitler invaded ussr these people were relocated to siberia central asia etc and after the war dumped in what was then east germany with no more than the meager clothings they wore a few married into the locals and became russified or became the nationality of wherever they ended up most of them resettled in germany after ussr d the mennonites etc went to russia during the th century for bigger pieces of land they didn t do so great in the russian revolution and folks like nestor makhno who is sometimes hailed as the ultimate freedom fighter slaughtered them en masse they fled all the way to altai in turkestan which is as far from the sea as you can get where they were last heard of a few lucky souls made it to canada and who can forget the people who emigrated to ussr during the great depression thinking the grass was greener there there is a reason that people mostly emigrate to anglophone countries for better or worse these countries are more accepting people from other cultures while countries like russia have long traditions of taking the welcome rug away many times
1, as a dark salvation maybe the topic has been already brought up if that s the case i apologize but i cannot help noticing a strong undercurrent of fatalism doomerism going on on the sub for example posts about thing having gone too far for anything to help posts about the idea of an incoming  as a liberating one dismissing any possible good news as wishful thinking or biased sources dismissing any possible tech breakthrough as hopium even on more mainstream platforms i e twitter and facebook dark humor about our impending annihilation seems to have reached an all time high of late or at least that s my impression granted not everyone here does it nor is it right to mindlessly herald any progress as a magical cure being a realist often implies a good dose of scepticism and or pessimism but may be there something deeper going on to be clear might some of us actively wish for some form of  to happen don t get me wrong i m not pointing fingers nor am i trying to call out doomers what i am trying to say is have things gone so far people are starting to see a hard reset as the only way out an increasingly chaotic unforgiving world is the apocalypse getting less and less fearsome compared to the idea of witnessing an increasingly boring dystopia a technology powered politically authoritarian darwinistically ruled future plagued by steady decline and rising competition over ever diminishing resources do our social and individual problems look so overwhelming now that  seems the only possible bailout either by destroying the oppressive systems we are tied to or by granting us a merciful death in a hopeless world is  becoming a dark salvation we can look forward to maybe the gordian knot is so difficult to untie that cutting it is becoming the only option sometimes i catch myself thinking this way as well

1,carlo caduff medical anthropology quarterly what went wrong corona and the world after the full stop submission statement this article offers a thorough and critical examination of the global response to the covid pandemic it argues about the rapidly changing media narrative and its disproportionate influence on policy and the reliance on the same neoliberal policies and elite consensus that laid the foundations of the crisis we are living now for instance by neglecting healthcare and having rationalized hospital capacity that fragilized the healthcare system before the covid crisis and tackles the disproportionate impact of restrictire measures on the poor and marginalized and its increasing of inequality the article also examines whether lockdowns are an expedient measure to avoid more politically challenging and fllexible measures to hide the incompetence of governments across the world and the failure of neoliberal policies to deal with societal problems and worries about the danger of relying on excessively relying on mathematical disease modeling neoliberal health policies nervous media reporting and authoritarian longings outside of political and democratic debates and the risk of further erosion of civil liberties and democratic processes abstract this article examines the global response to the covid pandemic it argues that we urgently need to look beyond the virus if we want to understand the real seriousness of what is happening today how did we end up in a space of thinking acting and feeling that has normalized extremes and is based on the assumption that biological life is an absolute value separate from politics the author suggests that today s fear is fueled by mathematical disease modeling neoliberal health policies nervous media reporting and authoritarian longings excerpts today many wonder how we ended up where we are how was it possible for a virus to trigger such a massive response that continues to threaten society and the economy with so little discussion about the costs and consequences of extreme measures why is there widespread agreement that aggressive interventions to flatten the curve were necessary and justified it seems that this unprecedented public health experiment occurred without sufficient consideration of the social political and economic consequences as a result of the world s largest and perhaps most stringent lockdown millions of daily wage laborers have lost their source of income in india health care workers have been attacked and evicted from their homes because they are seen as potential spreaders of contagious disease kalra and ghoshal neighborhoods have been scared into panic when an ambulance appears on the street due to the sudden ban on any form of transportation migrant workers have been stranded between the cities where they used to work and the villages where their families are living daniyal et al cancer patients have been unable to receive essential medical care because they cannot reach the hospital it is the poor the marginalized and the vulnerable who are most affected by drastic measures exacerbating already existing inequalities in kenya the police enforced a coronavirus curfew using teargas and excessive force against presumable violators of lockdown law namwaya in bangladesh the government created a special unit to monitor social media and arrest people for spreading misinformation about the virus hrw in hungary parliament passed a law allowing prime minister orb n to limit freedom of speech defer elections and suspend rules and regulations by decree gebrekidan in india state governments released companies from the purview of labor laws including occupational health laws to stimulate the economy sharma in lebanon the currency d leaving of the population in need of food aid chulov in the united states over million people have filed for unemployment benefits rushe and aratani the failure to consider the impact of extreme measures that have become the norm in many places in the covid pandemic has been stunning the destruction of lives and livelihoods in the name of survival will haunt us for decades major media outlets in the united states called china s locked city strategy deployed in and around wuhan harsh extreme severe and controversial emphasizing that it offered no guarantee of success qin et al a new york times article noted that china is trying to halt a coronavirus outbreak using a tactic with a long and complicated history fraught with social political and ethical concerns levenson experts quoted in the article called the lockdown of cities an unbelievable undertaking that would be patently unconstitutional in the united states that type of thing said james hodge a professor of law is obviously an excessive response another expert cited in the article historian howard markel pointed to the darker side of quarantine its use as a social tool rather than its scientific use as a medical tool in the united kingdom newspaper articles suggested that the chinese government would not be able to keep the city of wuhan closed for business indefinitely graham harrison the locked country approach seemed to obviate the necessity of justifying a differentiated strategy that might have looked unequal and unfair and that might have intensified social and political conflicts along multiple internal fractures and fault lines to avoid the political fallout of a differentiated strategy which would have required systematic testing government officials in europe and elsewhere invoked the politically expedient image of a total threat and suggested that we are all in the same boat and that we are all in this together the idea that regional lockdowns would not be possible and that it was best to treat the virus as a global threat that would uniformly impact all people involved conjuring an image of a united nation confronting a total threat that required everyone s sacrifice this image relied on a false assumption of equality solidarity came to mean not mutual support in a situation of uneven risk but rather generalization of a sense of danger across a national population perceived as a homogeneous body under attack the ideology of national pandemic solidarity putting everybody under confinement and treating everyone the same obscured the reality that lockdowns mean different things to different people and that not everyone is equally exposed or equally vulnerable both the virus and the lockdown disproportionately affected those who were already vulnerable along lines of age class and race where medical care is easily accessible with sufficient and well trained staff and with capacity flexibility patients are more likely to receive better care and survive in this sense it matters that spain turns out to have beds per inhabitants italy france germany and south korea although beds per inhabitants is a crude indicator it is noteworthy that germany can rely on over staffed intensive care beds out of which only were occupied in early april see mohr and datan grajewski this at a time when there were more cases in germany than in france and the united kingdom and slightly less than in spain and italy germany s was clearly not a health care system overwhelmed by a sudden surge of patients ironically organizations such as the oecd frequently scolded germany s health care system in the past for oversupply of hospital beds and its inability to rationalize hospital capacity kumar and schoenstein over the past five years hospitals across europe held numerous strike actions with doctors and health workers complaining of funding cuts a government reduction in the number of beds and a serious lack of medical staff leading to dire working conditions for emergency room staff chrisafis hospital systems in italy spain and france were on the brink of  even before the virus arrived the most telling demonstration of the structural contradictions of pandemic preparedness under neoliberalism occurred not surprisingly in the united states as american newspaper articles reported hospitals across the country deferred regular medical services to free up space equipment and staff for the pandemic response when patients started to avoid hospitals due to fear of infection a main source of income was drastically cut off causing huge losses that have forced some hospitals to let go of health care workers as they struggle to treat infected patients harris and schneider facing a financial nightmare hospitals filled their intensive care units with patients who did not really need intensive care so that they could charge more and make up for the financial loss additionally administrators cut salaries laid off hundreds of staff and sent others on unpaid leave weakening the health care system further in the midst of the pandemic response when a new virus appears things start to fall apart once everyone gets scared extreme measures are implemented in a more or less improvised manner and trillions of dollars euros and pounds are pumped into the economy to make up for the loss once the worst is over however the normal crisis continues and the structural fragilities remain caduff
1,global dimming some people on here have said that there could be catastrophic effects this year from the loss of global dimming due to the pandemic but all the sources i ve found say that emissions are only expected to fall by some even taking the very highest estimates for the aerosol masking effect i ve seen degrees that would only come up to about degree rise is that catastrophic isn t that easily within year to year variation also aren t aerosols supposed to fall out of the sky within days weeks tops shouldn t we have seen a temperature rise by now

1,i study atmospheric science and climate change ama hello r  my name is greg and i study and do research in atmospheric science and climate change i know you all are very worried about the climate and weather changes across the world unfortunately i see misinformation and fear mongering across this sub on a daily basis there certainly is a lot to be worried about but let me clarify your fears
1,some of the ways climate change will kill you actual effort post bear in mind that according to un estimates we re currently on track for degrees celsius of warming by heat death in a heat wave killed around people in europe around people died per day after degrees of warming those kinds of death inducing temperatures will be a normal summer rather than a heat wave at degrees large parts of the world will become literally uninhabitable to humans and at degrees working in the summer would be pretty much impossible for much of the us with new york city being hotter than present day bahrain and the temperatures in places like bahrain would be inhospitable after degrees of warming temperatures around the equator would cook you to death in a matter of hours if we ever reach degrees then half of the world s population would die from heat alone we will still have heatwaves alongside these hotter summers but they will be far hotter and therefore far deadlier as we are already seeing in instances like the heat wave in russia which killed people people per day died in moscow alone hunger for cereal crops every degree of warming leads to a decrease in yields meaning that if we experience a degree warming by we may have less grain to feed a larger global population grain currently makes up of the human diet this would also reduce the amount of meat we can produce since it takes pounds of grain to produce a pound of hamburger meat as well as the increases in heat the increasing prevalence of droughts should also be considered at just degrees of warming the mediterranean and much of india will experience frequent droughts straining global food supply at degrees thanks mostly to drought the world could enter a global food deficit needing more calories than the planet can produce at degrees there would be further drought in central america pakistan the western united states and australia and gt by without dramatic reductions in emissions southern europe will be in permanent extreme drought much worse than the american dust bowl ever was the same will be true in iraq and syria and much of the rest of the middle east some of the most densely populated parts of australia africa and south america and the breadbasket regions of china none of these places which today supply much of the world s food would be reliable sources going forward drowning on our current course we can expect between and feet of sea level rise by or if we keep to degree of warming unlikely we could still conceivably reach a feet rise these rises would force hundreds of millions of people out of their homes as coastal cities all over the world are submerged wildfires we are already seeing wildfires worsen those in the us burn twice as much land as they did in this could double again by and quadruple with every further degree of warming and the wildfire season has grown by two and a half months recent examples include the woolsey fire which caused people to be evacuated and the even worse camp fire which burned a whole town so quickly that the evacuees found themselves sprinting past exploding cars their sneakers melting to the asphalt as they ran another fire in colorado produced a volcano like foot eruption of flames now known as a fire tsunami things are worsening outside of the us too in fires in greenland burned times more than previously and in fires broke out in sweden finland and russia the smoke from the siberian fires reaching all the way to the us the fires in greece in killed and at one resort dozens of guests tried to escape the flames by descending a narrow stone staircase into the aegean only to be engulfed along the way dying literally in each other s arms whilst others burnt alive after becoming trapped in their cars natural disasters saw the once in years rainfall of hurricane harvey drop a million gallons of water for every person in texas on houston hurricane maria which killed at least and ruined the lives of many more the flood in south asia that forced million people from their homes and the already mentioned wildfires got even worse with a record breaking global heatwave hurricanes and tropical storms appearing all at once including typhoon mangkhut that killed and hurricane florence that killed and doubled the average annual rainfall in california after degrees of warming these natural disasters will just be weather we will have to invent new categories to describe hurricanes the ability for warmer air to hold more moisture will result in rain bombs like the one that hit hawaii in with inches of rain in hours tornadoes will leave longer and wider trails of destruction hail rocks will quadruple in size we are already experiencing more intense rainstorms than in the s in some areas its as high as water already as many as billion people do not have access to safe drinking water and billion do not have access to safely managed water for sanitation half of the world s population are also reliant on the seasonal melt of glaciers for their water supply at degrees of warming the himalayas will lose of their ice by resulting in widespread water shortages similar outcomes are expected in places like peru and california that also rely on glaciers at degrees the alps will lose of their snow by on our current course by million more africans could face water shortages by that number could be billion in asia alone and freshwater supplies for cities all over the world could decline by two thirds the increasing temperatures could also make the remaining drinking water unsafe by becoming breeding grounds for warm water friendly bacteria this happened in with lake tai on which million people were dependant likewise the heating of lake tanganyika in east africa devastated the fishing stocks eaten by millions of people unbreathable air already people die every day from air pollution the air quality index categories the risks of air pollution on a numerical scale the index tops out at the range warning of serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly and serious risk of respiratory effects in the general population at that level everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion in the chinese airpocalypse reached in the index and pollution killed million people in china that year in california in wildfires caused air pollution to reach on the index whilst in delhi its at an index of and breathing the air is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes each day by billion people will be breathing air classed as unsafe plague there are diseases trapped inside arctic ice that have not circulated in the air for for thousands or millions of years as this ice melts these diseases may be reanimated this has already happened several times a year old extremophile bacteria revived in an million year old bug brought back to life in a million year old one a russian scientist self injected out of curiosity just to see what would happen lol researchers have also discovered remnants of spanish flu infected million and killed million in and suspect there may be remnants of smallpox bubonic plague and other diseases many of which our immune systems will have no idea how to fight as the planet warms we will also likely see the spread of diseases such as yellow fever malaria and zika to new places since insects like mosquitoes will be able to inhabit more and more areas bacteria i think this outcome of global warming is by far the most horrifying inside each of us there are bacteria of which about is unkown to science some of this bacteria we are reliant upon to survive others may be completely benign however as temperatures rise there is the possibility that the bacteria may be rewired diminished or killed off entirely not only could this mean that those little bois inside us we rely on to survive are killed off or mutate and behave differently but it also means that the other bacteria just chilling in there mutates into something new with fatal outcomes this isn t just something that could happen in theory it has already happened in some other species the saiga a kind of antelope that looks like a moose fucked a goat had a bacteria living in its tonsils that posed no danger to it in any way then during a heatwave in may the bacteria mutated and emigrated to the saiga s bloodstream and then to its liver kidneys and spleen this resulted in a fatality rate dead saigas and the saiga becoming extinct in some countries its entirely possible that humans may experience a similar thing economic  on our current path it is estimated that million people will be dragged into extreme poverty over the next decade alone not to mention the impacts the stuff mentioned above will have unless you listen to stevie pinker obviously climate conflict each half degree of warming increases the likelihood of armed conflict by that s more war if we reach degrees of warming and more even if we stick to the degrees of the paris agreement in africa alone rising temperatures are expected to lead to more combat deaths by just original source
1,the united states and the aftermath of how much worse do you think it s going to get we have the gop re elected to of their seats for some fucking reason we have evictions frozen but the minute they re open the economy and start acting like everything s fine again people are going to have to pay in fines on average and the stimulus check is some real fuck you gonna do about it bitch energy the bills are laid out for us to see on the gov website and we can see that they dumped trillions into conflict spending with countries like israel and afghanistan creating new air craft carriers and allowing meal breaks to be itemized for the ber rich food banks have lines extending past the main roads and into expressways meanwhile we have the old white conservative fox watching house owning make my kids pay rent cos their lives are too easy these days gun owning karen wife having and proud boy for son having boomers ready to bust open black churches and burn blm banners while a guy who outright lost the election puts on a circus act and fans the flames these proud boys maga hats oath keepers etc are all receiving a collective shrug from law enforcement definitely due to enmeshment no doubt but at this moment all signs point to a brewing coup a governor was almost kidnapped and it almost happened a second time coronavirus and climate change aside it looks like we re reaching an acute social rupture with the us our country is all about performative normalcy and fascism won t stop just because a lung consuming virus and rising sea level threaten us all historians among us it looks like we re on a train that s on a tipping point soon are we entering a new civil war if not what is your prediction as to how bad things will get
1,covid protocols to instate a stricter government because  is sooner than projected this post is not meant to be pro or anti vaccination regardless of your opinion on those themselves it is clear and indisputable that the current crisis is being used to implement extremely stricter government interaction into day to day life perhaps the reason for this is that  is much sooner than anticipated if food water and energy sources are nearing their limits than having the infrastructure and bureaucracy in place to regulate consumption at the smallest levels would be necessary to maintain any sense of order if this is the case it would make sense for governments to assume greater and tighter control over everyday aspects of life before mass instability and anarchy can really take hold a controlled  is infinitely more desirable to those in control than an un controlled one thoughts
1,derrick chauvin case possiblities lot of people talked about riots happening after this case i also thought about the possibility of derrick chauvin might be killed by someone perhaps by someone in the prison system or there is an actual break in the prison and he s killed also starting more riots and chaos as well as having prisoners escape when the pandemic first started happening prisoners where released that were due for early release or were nonviolent nonsexual offenders this gets on the conspiratorial side but i think its possible to have more criminals the escape the prison system already there are demands under social justice reform to release prisoners due to the fact they may get the virus
1,aren t there some isolated relatively self sustaining places in the world that would fare better in the event of a  for the sake of this hypothetical i am excluding the possibility of total nuclear warfare to me the biggest threat to these small communities countries is invasion by the biggest world powers over recources however there are many places which don t have any fossil fuels so there wouldn t be much incentive for foreign molestation furthermore the global military powers can only invade foreign countries so long as they have a steady supply of fossil fuels as soon as oil is depleted any kind of advanced warfare is off the table it seems like these places survival is dependent on their ability to become locally sustainable between now and then i get that there will be innumerable problems other than military states but i don t want to exclude the idea of some kind of organized society living beyond the inevitable  of the current international system billions dead everything said and done the  of global capitalism the nation state and other terrible institutions might even be a good thing for humanity in the long run it seems like the best thing to do now would be to foster the survival of a select few places around the world which could fare best in the event of a  sorry for any stream of consciousness thoughts
1,where will hold out longest i have been wondering which territories people think will have the greatest resilience to the coming changes there seem to be a number of factors that would contribute to greater national resilience i consider the main factor being population density agricultural output and social cohesion i imagine many people have a different opinion on what would make a nation more resilient to climate change i would be interested in hearing where people think technological civilisation will hold out the longest i would hypothesise that the nations are most likely to hold out the longest are those with the smallest number of interconnections globally and therefore also the lowest vulnerability to systemic failure view poll

crisis which affects not only s o paulo but also the other states in the southeast region as the population gets confusing answers from the authorities ways are sought to prevent the largest city in brazil from collapsing among the emergency measures released friday january th was the controversial diversion project of para ba do sul river the plan calls for the waters to be diverted to relieve the empty dams of s o paulo but the basin of the para ba do sul the main source of supply for the the state of rio de janeiro is also drying up what kind of plan is this won t such a solution end up creating another problem there was once a river network that ran through a closed atlantic forest a river system so good that many people chose their environment to survive there were million people supplied by these flowing rivers hundreds of years later few atlantic rivers remain and the surviving rivers are suffering from the worst drought on record the para ba do sul river system supplies three states rio de janeiro s o paulo and minas gerais it is because of its importance that it is now the center of a controversy in the jaguari reservoir in s o paulo is planned the diversion of the para ba do sul river it is a project that is considered one of the solutions to the problem of water shortages in s o paulo to reach the place where you want to do the work you need to take a boat generally you would launch a boat from the pier but the dam is so dry that it took down all the steps before everything was under water it is now meters below the normal level water resource specialist edilson andrade will show the place of the proposed project fantastico the dam is now very dry edilson andrade yes it is almost zero net volume is only a once submerged forest shows its branches and in one of the corners of the dam we see the old city of igarat where the teacher sirlei da silva was born the remains of a playground in front of the church and the city center are visible my teenage years i spent here indicates sirlei he has not been to the city for years since the city was submerged with the construction of the dam what remained of igarat was meters deep now its exposed remains are a symbol of the drought this chaotic situation that we are experiencing is like reopening an old wound the exposed ruins of igarat are that wound says sirlei fantastico the work is then planned to be made here edilson andrade yes this place must be the place of the river diversion under the proposal six engines will pump water for km to the dam atibainha which is part of the cantareira system the cantareira system used by million people in s o paulo heard a dramatic prediction this week it would institute rationing of a two day rotation with water and five days without water said the director of the metropolitan sabesp paul massato yoshimoto the idea is to pump the para ba do sul there at a rate of about to liters of water per second enough to supply two million of the million inhabitants of greater s o paulo but for this to happen the paraiba do sul reservoirs need to recover first in this crisis situation i would not allow this volume to pass to s o paulo said edilson andrade in a drought like this according to experts the transfer of this water to the cantareira could create another problem fantastico the para ba do sul may become a new cantareira edilson andrade yes it can if it does not rain in sufficient quantity this summer and next it will become a new cantareira fantastico so then you would not give help to the cantareira system edilson andrade yes we need to have water to help the cantareira and there s only water if there is a recovery of the dam for para ba do sul it would not help much and would leave others in bad shape as well the dams of the cantareira and the para ba do sul are in the same climate zone they work under the same rainfall regime that is if it rains here it rains there too and if they have drought we have drought here too this work was announced last year at the the principle cost of r million but the bid that was opened friday january th had estimated expenses of r million almost three times more it will be funded from the federal government s growth acceleration program the forecast is that it will be ready in a year and a half s o paulo knows that this is not the best chosen alternative to the depleted jaguari resevoir it s simply the most expedient said environment secretary of rio de janeiro andr corr a an emergency solution for a crisis foretold look at this article that fantastico published in a ghost scares the country s largest city its water is missing almost empty the eight reservoirs do not support the needs of million users the largest reservoir of the cantareira system is a little over of its capacity that was years ago even then far from a new problem the project to be achieved now was drawn up last year a committee of experts made a para ba do sul study commissioned by the government of the state of rio de janeiro they advised against any work of diversion we can not imagine that we can cover our needs as well as others the metropolitan area and the state of rio de janeiro already must use another water source in addition to the para ba do sul and with the amount of use that has already been allocated an additional withdrawal actually will have immediate consequences says the researcher from coppe ufrj paulo carneiro last year the government of rio de janeiro was against the project now they have changed their mind we want to help s o paulo i will not be guided by a study in an emergency situation says andr corr a the secretary of state for environment argues that the work is decided but it will only work if the water level comes back up it will depend on the conditions of the river we are talking about a project that will take at least one year and eight months says secretary of environment andr corr a fantastico it has not become an obsolete work andr corr a at some point i believe that at some point we will recover the reservoirs the government of s o paulo ensures that the implementation will not harm anyone this project will not bring either good or bad to rio de janeiro this is a neutral project says secretary of sanitation and water resources of s o paulo benedito braga a second phase of the work provides a system of pipes that would bring water to the cantareira system from the para ba do sul i believe it is not realistically feasible says edilson andrade the para ba do sul problem will only get worse ernesto is an environmentalist who devoted his life to the para ba do sul he flew over the river in august the river was two meters below normal he says last week he made another trip by the same route up to half the journey was through areas of severe drought your attention is drawn to the appearance of many islands in the river but they are not islands just mounds of dry silt from the air you don t see much of a river you increasingly see a serious crisis and amongst the discussions of projects and bids a question still remains what if the water runs out
1,it s extremely difficult to plan for  i m definitely on board with the idea that things are headed nowhere good but i m not feeling any kind of immanent apocalypse on the horizon seems more like a slow decline and even if it speeds up it s hard to predict exactly how it will unravel i can t get past the idea that in so many ways life continues as normal despite some shockwaves here and there i feel like i actually wouldn t mind a little acceleration so we can really see what we re dealing with

1,violent outbursts and maniacal thinking in society due to subconcious awareness of  accelerating towards doom i am starting to think the uptick in mass shootings ridiculous protests about g masks etc and the qanon phenomenon are part of this people are angry and confused and have nowhere to direct their frustration it is only going to get worse the complete lack of mental health care availability in america is a problem people are unable to cope and unable to face reality evangelicalism has promoted the end of the world and that people do not need to worry they will be in heaven and the world will burn either way they generally anti science and conservative promoting antivax anti climate action the catholic church has been discouraging birth control all over the world for some time leading to over population hiv and aids epidemics throughout rd world countries there is no way to unravel this mess in time
1,where will the gw effects be milder at first i m willing to relocate i d like to stir up a discussion about where is the best location for the next decade or so on earth the scope will be to postpone the worst effects of global warming for as long as possible do you think this will be a high altitude area more to the north maybe southern hemisphere please jump in and explain your choice i for one thought iceland would be ok for the next decade some place like say hveragerdi i like small places i only need access to internet i would like to do my own gardening and depend less and less on supermarkets hverager i is m above sea level and located at n w hverager i has a population of for me that s more than suitable but maybe it s not inland enough or maybe it s the wrong hemisphere
1,opinion choosing between south korea and the usa i m wanting opinions here because i ve come to some realizations lately and want to ask a community that understands these things or maybe has as pessimistic realistic of an outlook as i do i m currently living in south korea and have been for a few years i speak korean reasonably well better every year and my legal status is stable i m at a point where i could see myself managing to keep living here indefinitely if i really wanted to that was already an option for me before but as i m sure you all know i feel far more comfortable living here at this point in time than back home in the usa it almost feels like winning the lottery or something at least for now i ve been realizing something i ve always thought of climate change as the big one i know it ultimately is but the more i read the more i realize that viral pandemics will probably happen much more often in our lives than we imagined and could be one of the major causes of social unrest and instability in the future read this sars happened in mers appeared in covid is happening now once every ten years or so a new deadly coronavirus is appearing and spreading they appear to be getting worse before sars coronaviruses weren t seen as a big threat they were mostly mild to moderate respiratory diseases however due to the double blow of population increase and climate change suddenly humans are in contact with animal species and environments that we weren t in contact with before the rate of viral spillover events is increasing what does that mean for us to me the question is whether i should stay in korea become as marketable as possible adopt the culture and become fluent in the language or go back to my home country where i fit in to some extent and speak the language and feel totally comfortable in the culture this is such an immensely personal question that it s almost pointless to ask but i m just curious what you would do in my place it s still surreal that this is happening when the shutdowns in wuhan occurred almost nobody believed me when i said it would get bad now that it s bad few believe me when i talk about the economic impact this will have oddly enough but even fewer believe me when i bring up the point that deadly coronavirus spillover events didn t occur like this before and now they do regularly isn t that something everyone should be thinking about it s clear that among the usa s many issues is this new one that something in the culture and government isn t fit to handle pandemics properly i believe this could be a massive issue in the future unless covid serves as the wake up call everyone needed but will people really hear the wakeup call s korea did with sars and mers why didn t the usa korea isn t perfect it s got so many other issues and i miss my home country a lot sometimes my plan was to move back eventually or at least somehow strike a balance between a life in korea and the usa but after seeing all of this i m really not so sure
1,you really think  can be avoided really the way the world is responding is exactly what they told us could not happen we are still in denial as a whole we are still destroying the planet faster than ever more this more that we are still consuming more than any sane society would this is a problem those that think we can still fix this are not understanding the whole picture we have done so much already and we show no signs of stopping as long as people consume nothing will change we the consumers have the choice and it s clearly been made the only question remains when the  will happen based off what i ve seen it could happen in the s i will stick with my name tho and project a  to occur by what about other people amp xb thoughts
1,any second now 
1,it baffles me how many people think that nuclear energy and fracking are safe i was talking to my climate change denying math teacher today who provided two points on how he thinks that these two unsustainable energy sources are safe he knows someone who is the head of a pennsylvania based energy company who insists that methane deposits were in the ground long before fracking began there go figure rebuttal correct me if i m wrong but he fails to forget that fracking cracks the shale under ground at least here in pa it does which thereby releases methane proving to be a public health hazard and also releasing a far more potent greenhouse gas obviously there is methane in the ground as is there in permafrost up in the arctic circle however when said methane is released by either co melting permafrost releasing methane or from hydroelectric fracking cracking open the ground to release it for energy consumption this is when it causes a problem second point he brought up since the introduction of nuclear power circa s s there have been only two catastrophic meltdowns that have resulted in an entire land area becoming uninhabitable for generations to come rebuttal as i just explained there are several dead zones across the world because of radioactive waste and there is yet to be a safe zone for storing lethal amounts of radioactive waste i should also mention that vast swaths of land take chernobyl and fukushima for example are uninhabitable because of safe nuclear energy yeah sure two major disasters where thousands of people were killed and large amounts of land from contamination by radiation and years of clean up needed to clear all of the radiation to reduce the risk of a global nuclear catastrophe are just little things there s no need to assess the risks involved and to phase out nuclear energy never mind that japan s most effective way to get rid of radiation contaminated water is to dump it into the pacific ocean here s another point i ve read on an info graphic from u xrm website ofindustrialcivilization com whom i thank for the information that the majority of nations that have nuclear energy in use also have nuclear weapons either being built or are already utilized so based on what i ve just explained why do people still think that nuclear energy is a good idea more so than they think hydro fracking is
1,those with children how to prepare and educate did i do the wrong thing i lie awake at night wondering if i should have bought children into this world i knew in advance what most of you guys and girls know the best times are over imo the first wake up was the crisis and now covid has shown how the pathetically vulnerable the world is hard lockdown in china showed me how weak i was personally i became perminatly afraid of being locked in when i get back to my home country i have to start thinking about the fine line of making my young children resilant but not bastards confident about the reality but not depressed has this been discussed before i know the first thing to do is make them join scouts as i was to learn about living rough and personally take them hiking camping to make them appreciate comforts that will soon disappear

1,counter point critical thinking check k miles through the western usa in the last months and things are remarkably good just a few minutes ago i happened on the post from a user who was speaking of a road trip that they ve been taking for the last months i was reading their post and sort of taken aback by their description of things as they saw them since july th or so of last year my partner our two initially three cats and our few belongings have travelled over miles through the western united states the trip has been made in two stints the first of about miles in a ft moving van from a moving company the second leg is ongoing and is at around the mile mark for this leg we are in a ft moving truck contrary to the post which i read earlier the western united states seems to be doing fairly well i did not experience any great buildup of trash or see any massive piles of things that weren t going to make it to landfill there were certainly a couple of places that talked about difficulties with the trash but there was nothing standing in the open in northern california on the coast the recycling plant has recently shut down the local cities have managed to deal with their problem and there is nothing standing in the streets we traveled through wyoming idaho utah oregon california extensively arizona new mexico texas oklahoma kansas and colorado the biggest shock was that there was literally no visible impact from the covid pandemic of the many hospitals that i ve seen in the last months none of them look like they were in any dire way beleaguered and short on supplies or anything like that i certainly didn t need to seek any medical attention but there didn t seem to be any strain on the system in fact in many cities it seems like folks just wear the mask and don t talk much about things my partner and i consider ourselves covid refugees as our living situation was upended due to the pandemic and it s consequences and it appears that many such people are out on the road right now it s no wonder that van living has been trendy for a minute as many of us have been reduced to some form of that the walmart parking lots throughout the united states at least those states that i mentioned here in the west all have a group of people sleeping in their automobiles in the parking lot every single night that was a little intense interestingly enough we have learned that walmart allows people to stay in their parking lots specifically in colorado we have been informed from a number of law enforcement officers that folks are literally allowed to stay at walmart not just sleep there for an evening my partner and i have personally seen individuals in recreational vehicle setups who have camped at certain walmarts for weeks at a time to be clear if you were to park your automobile like a regular street car at the walmart parking lot and just leave it would be towed within a number of days but if you are living in your vehicle and on that same parking lot they will likely only ask you to move your experience may vary contact your local law enforcement for information on top of that rather than seeing any massive lines for food banks or food pantries or even soup kitchens my partner and i have had easy and ready access to these services in every city and town that we ve gone to we have survived on the kindness and good will of people who have given their hearts and their time to come together and give there is no way we would have made it without the compassion of strangers that s part of why i wanted to make this post so that folks understand that though the system may  our humanity won t people all over the western united states are coming together to make sure we are all taken care of we definitely saw our share of grunge and our share of strife there are a lot of homeless people on the streets that is true the worst that we ve seen was in the central valley of california specifically in the modesto merced san joaquin valley area as well as northern california and eureka and arcata california these places have a lot of very mentally unstable homeless folks running around having said that my partner our cats and i have been safe the entire time we ve been on the road and never at any time have we specifically feared that someone was going to attack us or do us harm there is a special caveat to that in that i have massive size privilege i m ft and when coupled with the many facial scars i have and my general disregard for bullshit i manage to avoid a lot of trouble so again your results as a u haul living covid refugee may vary in general anyone living in their vehicle sort of huddles together in the parking lots it was a regular occurrence to go to sleep in an empty parking lot and wake up with a cluster of people living in their vehicles around my own another thing i d like to speak about is that tension between citizens and the police seems to be at a minimal level right now that seems completely counterintuitive to what i saw on the television before i left and it s probably the same thing that most of you are thinking if you read this but i have seen groups of homeless people and police officers dealing peacefully and trying to make the best of this situation the entire time i ve been on the street i have yet to find a pocket of folks who were espousing extreme viewpoints in a public place there are no more people with large signs signaling the end times on corners than ever before there are no angry mobs of racists vowing to clash there are no angry people looking for equal rights and burning things there are a lot of hungry confused intimidated individuals who are just trying to get by a lot of families who are struggling to make ends meet and wondering what the heck is going to happen with all this but there is not despair there is not a breakdown and there is not a lack of humanity or kindness we are all in this together whether in the united states or any other place in the world it s good for us to remember that humanity is driven to cooperate as a means for success for our species the system that is ruling us is about to fall all of us rats are about to chew through the walls of the ivory tower and that s for the better but the earth isn t going anywhere and things might get really weird before it s all said and done but we re not going anywhere either remember to pet your dog or your cat give your partner a hug if you have one don t fret if you don t have one and love yourself because you need to be your own best friend anyway if you re frequently on reddit go search with the random subreddit function and find some good communities there s lots of people who are talking right now and we all have time to be on our computers so there s plenty of places to find good interactions i love this subreddit and i check it everyday and it s a great way for me to figure out what s going on at large in the world i agree completely that s is about to hit the fan in a major major way and i can t say i m not interested in seeing how that all plays out but i worry that folks confuse the system crumbling with humanity crumbling the system in place and the structure of whatever we ve had that is physical society is probably going to change in rapid and dynamic ways but humanity is going to stick together don t let anybody try to tell you otherwise blessings to you and your family

1,in our current state green growth is an oxymoron in our current state you can t have simultaneously economical growth and preservation of environment or that is ecological sustainable i will give some of my reasons in the following we have continued globally with fast rate of growth there are more and more people that want or consume more and more but our profits and consumption stem from the destruction of environment so the more people who consume more the more we are destroying the environment this is why we have been emitting more greenhouse gases continuously over the last years despite the un climate change conference because the cop believe that growth is a imperative to tackle climate change but growth is the cause of more greenhouse gas emission since the introduction of alternatives to fossil fuels energy source they have not so far substituted it only add to our global energy consumption while the production consumption of fossil fuels has been rising because of the fact our economical modelling want to grow economically and so consume more fossil fuels to construct or maintain renewable infractures relies on fossil fuels technical issues of renewable won t allow a total switch to respond to the increasing demand of energy plus renewable technologies are not that clean as the metal extraction to build them does pollute its surrounding we live in a finite planet we are running out of resources such as sands fossil fuels or it becomes too unprofitable to exploit them metals so because of this we won t be able to switch totally to renewable technologies even if we do have access to large quantity of free resources exploiting still cause significant destruction of the environment for example extraction of minerals generate local land pollution society runs on fossil fuel it has been shown that economical growth correlate with fossil fuel production the more we produce fossil fuel the more we grow economically because of the inertia to change if we want to grow economically then we have to produce or consume more fossil fuels our economical modelling system turn the natural environment we exploit into trash our profits we generate stem from the destruction of the environment we are degrading the soils running out of resources deforesting polluting and so destroying the environment then what does growth means at individual level it means if you seek to be more financially wealthy consuming or producing more than your need even if you work for green company or consume green product then you contribute to growth and you are part of the problem if we are serious about tackling climate change or pollution or deforestation
1,switzerland screwed us by bowing to the obama administration switzerland used to have the strongest privacy laws it meant that the world s richest could hide in the shadows if they wanted well dammit they shouldnt be able to except that you really wanted them to be there the obama admin did not go after any of those rich that they said were hiding money it was all a big scam to get the information on who had money how much money they had and thus who could potentially provide a challenge to the elite the cabal the shadow governement whatever you want to call them so now in the last years general jones and general mcchrystal have figured out how to leverage any of those people and more importantly know who to watch because they could tip things against them so there will be no hidden figure stepping up to help us right the ship switzerland screwed us when they bent over for obama but good new mid level bankers did a cumulative days in prison

1,a new animated webseries seeks suggestions for guest cameos hi i m evan wilder i am a member of the accursed generation the millennials i enjoyed playing great video games like final fantasy vi and pokemon however unlike most millennials i hear i was told no at an early age if only more americans were told no when they decide to flip a house with no money down with bad credit today while i have spent about two years learning about the economy and even internalization i did this through learning to read through financial statements setting up business that takes in clients on a freelance basis researching trends and listening to interviews with peter schiff simon black david morgan and doug casey i then noticed that not many millennials would be willing to sit through those interviews or look through the government sites to learn about forthcoming dollar  and the opportunities it has which is saddening however i am fortunate to be working on a show that can educate millennials about the world economy and actually be enjoyable and fun post dollar follows two men one insane but prepared the other sane but ill prepared as they travel across the world thrown into unrest and pandemonium what we are looking for is suggestions in cameos from public figures in this space such as michael maloney and david morgan we want to build this series to be the best enjoyable and entirely accurate depiction of the dollar  feel free to offer suggestions here for who would make great cameos thank you so very much
1,advice for a younger person waking up to the reality of  i m an undergraduate student who s been pretty aware of the reality of climate change for some time but as the projections get worse and worse i ve had to confront that the world i m going to live in before i m even will be drastically different than the one i live in now my reason for posting is i have no idea what to do with this knowledge more than anything it s just really depressing and i have a hard time not feeling like everything i m doing getting my degree etc is pointless should i just keep going regardless maybe try to move to a state that will be less affected by climate change than the one i live in now texas

1,feminism and the  i will probably get a lot of shit for this post but i see feminism as a major contributing factor to the  one of the key concepts of feminism is independence through putting off marriage and child birth in order to gain an advanced education and have a career this naturally means that as feminism has spread maternal age has increased it s common knowledge that a maternal age over leads to a drastic increase in the chances of the child having a litany of health problems and birth defects due to the degradation of the dna within the unfertilized embryo over time many older mothers have children before the age of however if the maternal dna is considered degraded enough to pose a serious risk to the child when the woman reaches the age of it is highly unlikely that this all happens at the stroke of midnight on the women s th birthday it s a certainty that the embryo of a year old will be extremely lower in quality than the embryo of a year old in this day and age we are frequently exposed to carcinogens and ionizing radiation meaning that the natural degradation of maternal dna overtime will only be exacerbated even if the effects of this are not noticeable across a single generation small errors in the genetic code could pile up across subsequent generations we wonder why there has been an increase in mental health problems and disorders such as autism studies have shown that risk of autism is linked to higher maternal age the global iq is also decreasing i think this must be considered a factor to the  the biological clock still applies to men although much less severely sperm are produced pretty much until death embryos are not furthermore the studies i have seen relating paternal age to health problems in the offspring do not control for maternal age a year old man is much more likely to be reproducing with a year old woman than a year old therefore one can conclude that feminism has contributed to a decline in the genetic stock of the human race i m no church goer or mra but without traditional nuclear families it becomes very difficult to produce a next generation capable of carrying on the torch of civilization

1,is carbon footprint just a pr stunt bp british petroleum came up with the carbon footprint as a pr stunt based on a op ed in nyt to shift the responsibility from corporate to the individual level bp s pr campaign unveiled its carbon footprint calculator in so one could assess how their normal daily life going to work buying food and gasp traveling is largely responsible for heating the globe almost decades later carbon footprint is everywhere the pr director for the campaign at the time says that the term carbon footprint was a sham this means it assigns responsibility for climate impact to the individual while bp registers its own concerns by appearing already to be doing something about it while continuing its regular activity a few years after bp began promoting the carbon footprint mit researchers calculated the carbon emissions for a homeless person who ate in soup kitchens and slept in homeless shelters in the u s that would indirectly still let that person emit tons of carbon dioxide each year rather than perpetuating carbon footprint experts suggest instead fossil fuel emissions fossil fuel pollution or fossil fuel footprint what do you think

1,the reality of fossil fuels agriculture and overpopulation since the green revolution over fifty years ago the world population has nearly tripled all thanks to the use of fossil fuels of the nitrogen in humans worldwide connective tissue muscle brain and more all amino acids and thus all proteins originates from the haber bosch process where nitrate is synthesized from nitrogen using hydrogen found in fossil fuels as a result of synthetic nitrates nitrogen production in relation to agricultural has increased approximately in the last years with the majority of that since the s pushing the planetary nitrogen cycle to the brink effects include massive ocean dead zones off the coast of every major agricultural area on the planet creating algal blooms that rapidly consume thiamin vitamin b resulting in collapsing aquatic organism and shorebird populations make of this information what you will i am an advocate of permaculture and food justice but there are very serious realities from a two centuries long effort to mine the earth for nitrogen phosphorus potassium and topsoil wars were breaking out over fertilizer sources in the th century and german primary sources from the third reich indicate a major nazi objective and even cause for war was agricultural land few people outside the ecology sector want to think critically about the future decades and centuries i wish you all good fortune in the climate wars to come
1,why climate change won t lead to catastrophic  climate change has occurred on this human populated planet for millennia only in times of colder climates has it led to things like the black plague due to nutritional deficiencies if the climate increases by centigrade then agricultural expansion will only increase the human population carbon dioxide is only one of many variables that go into climate change yet it is a marker established by biased climate and ecological establishments animals biodiversity depletion leads to only biodiversity depletion not a complete meltdown of the agriculture agriculture is not dependent on exotic insects in protected rainforests coral reefs exist at the bottom of the ocean unscathed yet tropical exotic coral is seen as a marker that we are doomed to loose half the fish in the sea we will loose the diversity of wildlife which sucks but fish will be alive and well insects and birds will be alive and well deer and wild game in the north america will be here they will adapt evolve and yes insects will evolve within a decade we loose a lot of biodiversity but bees will exist dolphins will exist and people are reacting to the fact they will not thrive like they have water inland water resources will dry up so people will leave and find water there will be death but there will not be a global  if you are in the northern hemisphere you re probably fine sea level rise is slow and people will just move more inland this will all cause stress on society an it may manifest itself in a tyrannical leader or two and some more genocide but that is something that has always existed if you re prepping for climate related catastrophe in the us you re fooling yourself with your psychosis

1,driving social  and division in higher education sarah cartwright minutes ago to jodi i ve seen youtube videos where this is the argument students in humanities and cultural studies and gender studies get taught it s an exception to the term racism the dictionary and therefore most people right now understand it as meaning feeling superior to another group due to racial differences that s it simple definition easy to assess situations as being driven by racism or not no exceptions on the term a black dude in africa in an african town of african people can be racist to a white dude in that town if he feels superior and abuses the white dude because of that feeling but in these institutions they ve been redefining the term for what reasons is unknown but lots of people consider it a conspiracy topic the idea is racism power prejudice so therefore because of collonialism and historic events a black guy in an african town mistreating a white dude can t be racist because he lacks social power ignoring being located in a majority black african town it s prejudice at worst the scary part is this opens the door for people to be very racist and deny it as such it works for any group not just the black white dichotomy jewish people have power due to being a lot of bankers news people scientists and so on so other groups can t be racist to jews because of this imagine nazi s hiding behind the argument i m not racist they have institutional power it creates the environment where people believing this kind of thing can do great evil while avoiding a lot of self reflection on racist behaviour scary indeed what kicked this essay off was the following comment i saw on reddit just now where a dude explains a big reason just why it s so scary these ideas will end up being had by people in positions of power argh don t take my word for it nor the random comment below google something like racism is prejudice and power it s a very deep rabbit hole and seems engineered to cause social violence and social breakdown martin luther king would be horrified he was all about judging a person on their actions alone not their superficial attributes worth reading yet here s a way of thinking that gives a person a get out of trouble card when being evil to a group of people by judging a persons behaviour on their physical cultural identity not their own motives it s a massive step back for everyone and sows the seeds for enabled discord america millennial conservative score hidden hours ago you don t understand you cannot be racist against white people super boss throwaway score hidden hours ago you laugh but i was actually taught this by a college professor in a college classroom according to their definition being racist towards whites is called being prejudiced not racist same exact actions but the defined term changes depending on the skin color of the aggressor and victim and all this is meant to treat these people with different skin colors equally jreed originalist score hidden hours ago in college right now about half of the students at my school fervently believe that crap like or dislike folk like jordan peterson they re absolutely on the nose when it comes to warnings about academia these students are going to be leaders in twenty years we think things are bad now but think about it the crazies of today were inculcated with their beliefs from the universities in the s and s right when critical theory began to creep into the classroom what will today s students therefore believe in when they re the ones at the helm years from now surely it will be much worse edit hell to helm
1,weekly observations november what signs of  do you see in your region all previous observations threads are available here
1,the industry of gaslighting our culture gaslighting manipulate someone by psychological means into questioning their own sanity people typically experience gaslighting at an individual level one spouse may gaslight another in order to gain control over the relationship for example here are the signs of one individual gaslighting another they deny they ever said something even though you have proof they use what is near and dear to you as ammunition they wear you down slowly over time intensifying the gaslighting as they go their actions do not match their words they know confusion weakens people they accuse others of the problems they have called projection gaslighting is a powerful technique which is why it s so unfortunately common in a world where people are desperate to control each other using gaslighting on an entire population to better control it is not a new technique yellow journalism was doing it a hundred years ago kings did it with their proclamations your negative feelings about life aren t real you just don t understand but don t worry i m doing what s best for all of us so you ll just have to trust me or something of the likes is a refrain heard over and over from authorities throughout history self preservation often trumps compassion when people feel as though they might lose their position of power as unfortunate as that is it seems to be the truth and here we find ourselves at a point in history where again the ruling power structure is on the defensive and finds itself challenged and again we see it resort to gaslighting an entire populace but the internet changes the game social media and online chat and message boards gave people ways to communicate like never before making geographical distance irrelevant a golden era was available that i quickly disappearing as companies and governments realize the propaganda potential of this network people thought communication on the internet was genuine and organic and it was now it has become corrupted just like yellow journalism but many don t realize many still think this is organic culture and i even get fooled myself it is not organic it is manufactured culture creating false consensus making us all look like we are one way when we re actually another hoisting a banner over our heads that few of us actually agree with i am very glad to see people investigate these things and bring them to light like correct the record ctr and now share blue which has replaced it and perhaps some in this sub may investigate the opposite side of the aisle in this regard as well that is equally important because it is the system as a whole that is corrupted at all levels not just one half of it and not only is this happening politically but it s happening in the corporate world with advertisements and even with different governments around the world each trying to convince you they re the true good guys here so we real humans are stuck in this echochamber of manufactured bullshit many people believing it to be real if the matrix ever were a real thing this is it many do not want to be unplugged because they re so emotionally invested in their side aka tribalism has hijacked their thought processes through an emotional override wedding them to their ideological stances even if those stances don t make sense they do it to fit in and be on team good guys whoever they think that is all our major forums for public communication across the internet are being exploited and destroyed by paid and automated messaging that dilutes our real culture and attempts to replace it with a fake one that is crafted by those already in power gaslighting us all in the process

1,valuable people will choose a police state before  it is expected that leo will become stronger and they will have a greater leeway on how they do things and the taxpayers like that the leo killings usually don t occur in the nice areas except for the occasional intruders they occur in poorer areas with a lot of troubled people middle class people who drive nice suvs except for some ethnic groups i won t mention usually don t get killed by the police the police is doing some kind of duty to the society by removing potential troublemakers i e poorer people to keep the world safe for those who do matter i wrote about this kind of stuff about years ago and the trend is accelerating those who create value know the police won t f k them the police is not stupid they know who to not f k against they don t kill richer people since if they do they might be in some serious shit the upper and upper middle class like police state since that makes them much safer richer people in totalitarian societies actually tended to feel safer than their counterparts in freer countries they like the leo themselves feel nothing about the innocents getting killed as long as they are safe that s the only thing which matters with the advance of better leo machines rebellions protests etc will disappear and i predict that after a period of adjustments most people now dispirited demoralized will just beg to die in one piece a request which won t be honored always frankly speaking too many people had too much freedom in the last century it is ending we have had peak freedom it is time for a more ordered more obedient and more docile society in order to face a world with much less natural resources
1,misinformation first a plea to the mods please don t remove this as i always see this being said on this sub and it s starting to annoy me people always blame billionaires are running the world they re everything bad with capitalism they have too much power they do hold power you re just overrating it well they don t hold that much power nor wealth all together they hold around trillion dollars while millionaires hold approximately trillion dollars so who s really in control simply no one no one has absolute control over anything that holds value to anyone else in a world where everyone is always striving for more everyone s trying to get to the top you don t really have a top there isn t some big club where they all meet together instead it s smaller clubs trying to beat the other one s no one goes in a room and goes man how can we exploit poorer people today because simply that has been established loooongg ago as with anything there s alliances people who help projects that help them advance or diminishes their opponents we all tend to make the universe and things about us to make it more relatable but what most people are is collateral damage and the real culprits aren t t just billionaires but it s the entire wealth class so maybe now you could understand why most people wouldn t want to tax the rich because it affects them in turn from project contributions to other things have a good day and again i know this isn t  related directly but more of what most people falsely blame  on which is still relevant imo and i feel like these kinds of discussions are necessary for a more insightful view on 
1,maul the mall this sub has had stories about shopping malls gradually closing and being abandoned time magazine put out an article on this topic while the closing of shopping malls may be bad for the economy there are a few things that i consider positive and a few actions that can maximize the benefits of this phenomenon if the closing of shopping malls reflects decreased consumption then this is a positive from an environmental standpoint however when shopping malls close down the abandoned buildings can give attract the less savory elements of society and then we have to deal with urban blight however if malls were down sized and transformed then we could benefit societally as well as environmentally malls require quite a few resources to build rather than let these blighted buildings stay intact an environmentally conscious group could gradually dismantle those buildings and recycle the wires pipes and glass additionally some of the buildings could be left standing and be transformed into either community centers or perhaps housing units i ve seen some malls that are built next to apartment complexes galleria mall in houston tx usa is an example while this specific example is rather pricey cheaper and smaller versions could pop up in suburbia additionally the demolished buildings could be replaced with parks or community gardens it would take some effort to rebuild the soil but it could be done if community gardens replaced the demolished part of the mall while housing units were build either next to the mall or within the mall itself then our nation s food security would increase and people s health would benefit from being able to eat locally grown food i m sure many former employees of major retailers could be temporarily employed to transform these malls i know there are tree planting organizations in the us and world wide i would love to see these organizations partner with some demolition crews to replace blight with greenery i know i m being overly optimistic and climate change can easily scuttle any attempts to start gardens if any such movement exists please message me and i will promptly join in the meantime i m trying and succeeding to raise awareness among my family and my work colleagues

1,trump s policies could cause an economic  economists have mentioned repeatedly that trump s policies could start a depression the biggest problems are import tariffs and deregulation of the financial industry well trump is starting to implement these strategies however we would be lucky if this only resulted in a depression when the great depression started in the late s the world was in a much better place economically first there was still a lot of cheap oil in the ground cheap energy is essential for economic growth now most of the cheap oil is gone and new oil fields are much more expensive to exploit second in the s the global population was much lower population growth is one of the main drivers of economic growth now the global population really cannot grow further without causing sustainability issues indeed the un actively tries to reduce population growth additionally with interest rates already at or even negative central banks cannot really lower interest rates much further so if there is another depression the world simply won t be able to economically grow out of it

1,people will not become savages during  hello i ve been lurking this subreddit for a while last march when covid hit to be more specific and i want to share my take on  based on living in a country that is in a perpetual state of  lebanon i have read a lot of posts implying that there will be a moment when things get bad enough that the majority of people will descend into pure sadism and barbarity in my experience this doesn t happen as things get worse more people will be pushed to commit crimes and likely hurt others others will join unsavory groups that will harass communities and make life harder for others however they are still the minority most people just want to get by and are much more willing to ask for help rather than take it by force i also believe the descent into  happens very slowly i think we ve all realized that this year despite covid and people dying a day society kept moving one crisis is not enough to change courses and change everything it will all build up and as more disasters happen it will eventually reach a breaking point but it will take longer than you think and we ll see the signs everywhere even in lebanon where they have not had a government in over a year where their main port exploded with no one held accountable society keeps moving society is more resilient than you think as it is ultimately made up of people who do everything they can to continue living perhaps america is worse off due to its individualism and lack of community although that is not true everywhere but in either case there is no doubt that america has a long way to go before it faces  seen on a scale like lebanon

1,our problem with stuff and why doing without it will be the hardest aspect of  for many people we love consuming stuff because it allows us for a moment to keep our mind busy or to increase our social status and to forget for a moment just how miserable our life truly is most people love to show off their stuff a new car a new bag a new coat a new watch etc to other people as it makes them feel more important and allows them to increase their social standing in society this regardless of other people not caring who has never met someone who acts like a complete douchebag showing off their new toy and acting all cocky about it the other type of stuff is the one that will keep our mind busy and entertained for a while that allows us for some time to forget how pathetic our entire existence really is a new phone a new toy a new game the constant stream of distraction on tv etc these allow people to stop thinking about the reality of existence and to stop realizing or to forget the harsh truth true happiness can be reached by other means and is more about your state of mind than about consuming stuff problem is that most people have becomr addicted to consuming and it will be really difficult for them to do without it

1,school what should a state of the future look like me essay what should a state of the future look like states are always bound to external conditions that make their existence in a certain form possible in the first place so in order to imagine a state of the future one must first imagine what these conditions will look like in the future in the future one big factor will be decisive sustainability the term presupposes development with a view to the future so it will not happen at the expense of that future examples of unsustainable development are the use of fossil fuels for energy production the consumption of irreplaceable resources of the earth and the progressive destruction of the ecosystem of our planet which makes our life possible in the first place all this is happening today as fast as never before and with an ever increasing speed the social and economic mentality that exists today which is often described as that of a consumer society is anything but sustainable and is thus abolishing itself the price of sustainable development or at least long term development since sustainability as such cannot exist is above all the renunciation of immediate profit it can be found in very many human behaviours it is expressed in saving money in the desire for higher education or qualifications and also in the desire to have children in the medium term all these things mean investing resources for long term profit whether in the form of a well paid job or a happy family this principle of renunciation seems obvious on a personal level but on a social level it is no longer individual psychology that plays a role but a kind of mass psychology especially in democratic systems this manifests itself in the blurring of the boundaries of one s own responsibility and all too often in the forgetting of this principle however since humanity has already reached such a scale and is able to influence its environment as never before so far only in a negative way one has no choice but to take on this responsibility notwithstanding such social movements now emerging to protect nature which in the broadest sense means protecting mankind the crucial facts are that the emission of greenhouse gases is still increasing year after year as is the consumption of limited earth s resources while the burden on the environment is becoming extreme and growing no doubt very serious measures are needed to stop this after all it has all been neglected over many decades and yet thanks in part to modern media society any meaningful measures degenerate into little more than media effective campaigns this happens because real measures are not compatible with the existing social model and inevitably have to be unpopular consumer oriented wishful thinking is electable but the problem cannot be solved in this way humanity thus comes up against limits that can be very objectively measured and are not up for negotiation either it acts or it disappears and so every state of the future if it exists must also recognize these limits and develop accordingly can it be a democracy perhaps but only if a majority of the people become aware of the extent of the dangers and are prepared to accept economic and political renunciation but what then appears as a possible reduction of personal freedom is in reality only its return to a meaningful framework where the freedom of the other person begins no consumer today can live within this framework because his actions are increasingly polluting the environment at the expense of the whole society so it is not only necessary to voluntarily turn away from a harmful way of life such a way of life must not be allowed in the first place just as it is not allowed to commit murder however based on my experience and my own observations i believe that our society in its present form will not be able to collectively impose such a self restriction who would vote to ban cars who would advocate halving their own income or would like to not be allowed to fly one s own short term interest triumphs almost always especially in our consumer oriented society for this reason my idea of a future state is also completely different from today s reality it is called the concept of technocracy in this concept important decisions are made exclusively by persons qualified in the respective field who embody the legislative and optionally also the executive branches in the sense of the current separation of powers these so called technocrats derive their legitimacy not from public approval but from the rationality of their decisions it is impossible to prevent the radical confrontation with environmental issues and qualified people are by far the best at dealing with them a possible concept of such a future state which comes to my mind relatively spontaneously is based on such a system of government all relevant sectors of energy resources education economy the state budget and research are subject to extensive councils of qualified scientists academics psychologists sociologists etc these councils are not exposed to such irrational complications as the election campaign democratic populism government formation problems etc they can thus most effectively facilitate sustainable development meanwhile democracy continues to function at the level of local self government at the level of culture microeconomics and possibly also at the level of the media a technocratic government must have an optimal degree of decentralisation and protective mechanisms to prevent the formation of unforeseen centres of power i e a potential non technocratic takeover in this state human rights are of course fully recognised and reason and humanity are characteristic features of that state however individual freedoms in this state are restricted in that they must not undermine the very basis of society s existence in any way just like in our society in concrete terms this means for example a rapid ban on fossil fuels and numerous bans on the inefficient use of the existing resources of the state itself and the world insofar as it is not a world state a person can freely develop his or her personality in this state but the state creates certain guidelines and makes recommendations to the individual for example for certain professions of benefit to the public to participate in the technocratic government however one must be highly qualified just as for a pilot career one must also have a pilot s license and the extensive flying experience that goes with it determining the future of a society is much more difficult than that as long as mankind had seemingly infinite resources and energy sources at its disposal it did not seem relevant how to deal with them in politics therefore the outdated misconception persists that reality is somehow subject to political convictions and can be freely chosen a state of the future must accept the conditions of reality and not put them up for discussion it may perhaps appear that such a state would have less legitimacy from today s perspective but in this case one can already ask the counter question what legitimacy can the current system have when it threatens to end the very existence of humanity i believe that it can have none at all
1,shitpost friday ok i m out so in the tradition of shitpost friday i m out for a while it s been really not fun it has a few things of note i first joined r  when the quote on the sidebar was civilization can die because it has already died once that s a bang up quote it gets you because it s so much truth so compactly delivered so many civilizations have followed the same trajectory of our current and the singular monolithic civilization in the first clause like a more erudite and logical neil armstrong one liner civilization now being global as it is just a beautiful quote the mods should really look at putting it back in rotation so why am i taking a break from r  and actually all of reddit well the mind is ok i would say i am still fabulously well adjusted the doctor i saw at urgent care the other day would beg to differ no suicidal ideation here no dark thoughts other than the impending famine war and genocide it s simply that as the old saying goes the mind is willing the body is not it does not matter that i have long internalized the state of the world and have worked my way through all the phases of grief i am simply now in a constant state of flight fight as a result of dealing day to day with so many happy deluded people as such my body reacts to the smallest things to increase my blood pressure to or more therefore my bp is up there for a good portion of the day these are not healthy levels for a good portion of the day and to think i scoffed at the warning on the sidebar when i joined but the removal of my happy delusion has proven me wrong to the newcomers perhaps the following will save you some time yes many of the links published on this sub just like increasingly in r worldnews are to articles that summarize respected peer reviewed papers this was the first chip away at my idea that this place was for the insane yes the system is complex  will be systemic the feedbacks severe the failures cascading i m amazed that systems science has been co opted so by neo liberalism and turned severely away from pondering the possibility of our demise ahem economists yes i was once the frequenter of such places as r  and r singularity this sub made me realize that technology is less an enabler of a fantastic future but a byproduct of mass consumption it is part of the delusion you might see it as a conspiracy run by fossil fuel companies and originating in the middle of the last century but you can just as easily pin it upon some selected human trait to default to optimism for if man looked around and saw the pointlessness of things man would have surely laid down and refused to get back up a few hundred thousand years ago the most valuable thing r  has taught me is to look at things systemically when you do every aspect of modern western i mean global life becomes a horror because the tiniest things are multiplied a million or billion fold and backed by a global system of energy expenditure resource consumption and ecosystem destruction this is the core of the modern delusion because you need this you really do please ignore the black robed man with the farming apparatus in the corner good bye for a while perhaps and good luck

1,every generation has had its existential challenge there s a peculiar strain of thought that s popular with the older generations every generation has had its existential challenge the lost generation had the first world war the greatest generation had the second world war the baby boomers had the cold war the millennials we will have climate change i m australian last year i had the pleasure of handing out how to votes beside bob katter mp bob i was wearing labor reds he was in centrist alliance oranges helping our local independent stand up i talked to him about climate change and russian activity and he said back in my day we were very worried about soviet nuclear missiles and we hid under desks and so on and now everything s fine he then went and had a lamb shank and a coffee it s something i ve seen in online conversations about brexit we got through the battle of britain just fine this whole brexit thing will be a piece of piss if we got blockaded bombed and torpedoed what s a little friction in a trading agreement who cares it s like teenage angst generalized to be the growing pains of an entire generation this is just part of growing up you ll get over it don t worry about it you don t have any perspective on what you re going through but we do since we survived our special generational struggle what s glossed over is that not everybody survived the old generational struggles millions of people died in the second world war they were starved to death frozen to death shot to death they died of diseases they lost their homes there were great flows of war refugees there were camps there were enormous efforts of adaptation people s food was rationed people dug bunkers in their backyards people were conscripted cities blacked out at night and people died in korea vietnam afghanistan too it somehow doesn t register that that is what we re talking about when we re talking about  it s fair to say that war is an absolutely miserable time we also could have avoided this one but instead we have the survivors of the last ones telling the dead of this one hey it s not a big deal a lot of people would disagree with me to say that  will be greater in its scope and demand greater adaptation i don t think that s untrue but i think for the average first world person these times are the best comparisons we will see people hoarding tinned food in shabby backyard bunkers we will see rations especially of coffee chocolate and other rainforest products we will see great engineering projects like the manhattan project or the wunderwaffe as government desperately dumps money into hail mary technologies we will see conscription though into labour battalions in attempts to transition to new infrastructure we will see camps of people like we see now only built to scale for massive climate driven migration waves we will see black out periods it s only things are going to get that bad then not get much better

1,i honestly think the border wall camps separations are pre emptive psychological warfare against potential climate refugees given that biden seems to be continuing these policies i would say that this seems to be a reasonable hypothesis as to why this is occurring continuing refugees will likely be somewhat less likely to flee to a country with a publicized track record of sterilizing refugees and forcibly separating refugee families as far as i m concerned illegal immigrants are refugees this sub seems to operate under the assumption that rich people the government lack awareness as to what is coming if you assume that they do know the growing trend of authoritarianism makes much more sense the border measures won t help much in the long run but due to the psychological impact of such policies i could see it delaying the initial migration i assume that the government wants to use this delay to ramp up eco fascist policies to stem further refugee movement into the country assuming that elites are aware of the coming  also makes much of the unscalable hopium tech look a lot more like bunker gear although that s another topic for another day this is my first post here and i apologize for any broken rules or if this seems like a conspiracy theory which i suppose it is
1,how much does climate change increase gdp or is it good for the economy climate change has multiple impacts and all causes change our civilisation economy counters change with economic transactions these can be small purchases from woolly hat s and sandbags to mega projects like the venice tidal barrier so from a strictly economic standpoint climate change is good as it increased gdp right the thing is wars are also probably good for the economy yet we have not escalated our response to climate change why not as this would surely make much more money

1,discussion criticisms of the how to enjoy the end of the world talk by dr sidney smith i watched the talk after seeing it recommended on this sub and wanted to discuss a few points i will link it at the bottom for anyone who wants it firstly a key idea in the talk is the separation of what he calls the real material economy and the financial economy the idea that our production of tangible goods and services is already falling due to energy constraints and consequently he proposes that redistributing fiat currency can do little to improve the quality of life of the poor he also says this is why working class wages are stagnating because their output is stagnating using the example of bezos he says bezos is not eating millions of burgers and driving millions of miles with the absurd amounts of money he earns daily he s not consuming significantly more tangible resources than an average american therefore taking his monopoly money and giving it to the starving is not necessarily going to afford them more resources how true is it that our tangible production is already falling and if it is is it really falling due to energy constraints specifically at the moment before covid we are experiencing incredibly cheap and abundant oil due to shale and opec price wars so much oil we were actually paying people to take it instead of storing how can energy constraints be contributing to a fall in production if production is indeed already falling talking about shale oil specifically he also says that no shale company has ever made a profit and this is because the eroi is not high enough for shale to be useful i think this is false and the problems with shale s profitability is solely due to opec dumping and market manipulation the eroi itself is no problem although the carbon emission obviously is a problem all this to say i do not believe we are at any risk of affordable oil shortages in the coming decades and this will probably not be a contributing factor to any production bottlenecks but i am worried that pursuing income redistribution or a ubi may be far less important than people think if it really is a shortage of physical resources we re facing i have some other small criticisms of the talk as well for example he dismisses nuclear fusion outright because they ve been working on it for years and it hasn t happened yet but in fact the first large scale fusion reactor is under construction right now in france and expected to be online in he also says that one solar power is not viable for grid electricity and that two liquid fuels are impossible to replace in freight because of lithium scarcity but emerging battery technologies could solve this problem fairly quickly granted until the new batteries actually do emerge we will not be able to rely on solar energy or replace liquid fuels and will face the energy cliff when we run out of fossil fuels in a few decades he also does not explore tidal or geothermal energy at all which since they re always available could potentially eliminate the storage problem for grid electricity at least the talk
1,nuclear war faster than expected india s news network ndtv said percent of india s population will have no access to drinking water by according to a report by the national institution for transforming india niti aayog the country s principal planning organisation according to the international monetary fund imf pakistan ranked third among the countries facing severe water shortage in may the pakistan council of research in water resources pcrwr announced that by there will be very little or no clean water available in the country shukla the dispute over the kashmir region a flashpoint between india and pakistan for more than six decades is hugely intertwined with water security both countries claim the whole region but each only controls a part of it both countries india and pakistan are set to suffer from extreme water shortages and a disappearance of clean drinking water among half of each countries population the two countries have been fighting over kashmir a water rich area where each side has been building water dams in cutting the other side off a nuclear war between pakistan and india is likely to invoke involvement from the not so friendly neighbor china and it would be a replay of ww from that point on remember this is something that could happen in this decade and extremely plausible to happen in the next decade even if the conflict between pakistan and india stays between the two countries only if they fire their nukes it is expected that more than billion people will die from starvation from the research of luke oman and alan robock this isn t counting ground zero deaths or radiation poisoning and this isn t taking into account that other countries will definitely be involved in the conflict merry christmas

1, results from unrestrained desire the world economy is based on stimulating people with energy any desire catered to results in desensitization requiring ever increasing amounts of energy to sate further you will find endless comments on the internet about how we need nuclear coal etc because solar wind just isn t enough not enough energy for what reminder you only need food water shelter nice things like mosquito nets are quite low energy to make too the underlying assumption is that people must never leave a desire unsatiated they say the child must never be told no this is the talk of the box people when you are born in a concrete box you become this way without space to roam and trees to climb you become restless and miserable so substitutes are sought they leave you with life long escalating addictions you become fearful since your immediate needs are not under your direct control farming hunting your personality your drives goals and fears are set during these early years i am a box person and so is almost everyone here ever wonder how people can talk so much yet so little changes behaviour is hard to break once ingrained i make baby steps but it s not as much as i d like

1,many of the s the farther they lay in the past societies leave less traces and hardly the deeper reasons why they could not see it coming before it hit them in the face looks like it will be the same for us then the ancient societies could not tell us what happened because the barely survived and had more urgent things to do than tell us what finished them off by the collapsing of our global economic civilisation all those many d civilisations before us neither left any prediction or scarcely even a report in the moment of  showing even a tiny understanding what hit them in the face it always seems to have happened out from nowhere all of a sudden and left the people puzzled of what had happened to them just as it will go with us

1,i m sure that most would find this absolutely ridiculous but i thought i would ask if anyone would care to read what i found psychic predictions i understand that a lot of people find psychics ridiculous and such but i found a website of psychics that sort of band together to make predictions for the future discuss what they are seeing and post their predictions on this one website they have had many successful hits and some misses of course too they all seem like genuine honest people and they have pages upon pages worth of predictions far in the future there s so much you can read on there for free it goes out like years i donated dollars to their website as i appreciate them and i am a spiritual person who does believe in this stuff even though i know it sounds really silly because of my donation i was sent recent predictions they have made for the s decade and was wondering if anyone here would actually want to read that and maybe have a lighthearted discussion about it taking everything with a grain of salt of course because obviously none of it could end up being true of course i don t want to break any rules or anything i think there is content in these predictions that is relevant to this sub comment if you would like to read it i guess and i will post in the comments
1,what do you envision for the coming decades i m struggling with two main threads of angst regarding what the future holds as a parent i feel compelled to not ignore them the main topic of concern is climate change the other topic pertains to social drift toward an orwellian government oligarchy and fascism the two are related the climate thing has a cliffhanger vibe in my outlook i see a lot of technological potential for humanity to move toward a more sustainable model i think advances with batteries desalination synthetic meat and dairy ccs etc will give us at least the theoretical capability to avoid an apocalypse given the delay between forcing from greenhouse levels and climate equilibrium and the fact that transition away from fossil fuels will take time i think we re committed to increasing gg levels until at least mid century and will approach co ppm of minimum the inertia of sea level rise seems like we are committing ourselves for the forseeable future i hold out the possibility but my imagination is not latching on to anything that will move relatively warm water away from the ice sheets i envision that sea level rise is the trigger for a financial shock flood insurance pricing and availability will be a trigger affected asset classes include coastal real estate mortgage loans government bonds and fossil fuel reserves a region like s florida will lose a lot of desirability as it s beaches disappear before most essential infrastructure is inundated i m seeing the timing of the financial shock as being a function of confidence in sea level rise projections if the data for the next years confirms moderate to bad projections about marine ice sheet instability we may need only another inches of sea level rise before the market prices the risks fully coastal municipal governments will not have the resources to fund adaptation and mitigation efforts and will be faced with a declining tax base it s going to be up to federal governments and international agreements to make triage decisions and step up investments in energy adaptation and mitigation the committment required to transform our infrastructure and deal with the collateral damage will be no less than what the world put into the great wars of the th century how are current oligarchy serving government and media institutions going to evolve i don t know the answer to that question part of me thinks that necessity is the mother of invention and we ll come together and another part of me is imagining the grapes of wrath on steroids we live in interesting times and i think a big test is approaching faster than we think
1,how do you cope up with what s happening around you i live in a third world country and everyday i hear news about women getting rapped kids getting rapped it got to a point where i ve stopped getting into discussions about it why everyone complains but no one has a solution i ve uninstalled all the news apps i wasn t on social media anyway except for reddit but today i saw another case from my shit country of a kid getting gang rapped i broke down what is happening what do i do how do i close my heart to the sufferings of others it ruins my days and the news will keep coming back to haunt me so how do you cope up

1,ps xbox x gpu cpu shortages sign of the times i know it sounds trivial but hear me out please for my whole life years i followed gaming console and gpu launches and the shortages within the first few weeks are common the shortages we see now are in my opinion unparalleled the trigger to write this post is a statement from microsoft on a dutch tech site that they expect to somewhat meet demand by at least april considering sony uses comparable parts amd cpu gpu in their ps i can t see why their production will be less as problematic also we have seen shortages for computer parts for years now it s only becoming worse some time ago i posted this on the ps subreddit hinting that this maybe this has something to do with disrupted supplychains and moreover scarce rare earth metals needed for production of complex computer parts it didn t land well most people blaming mass buy of scalpers creating more scarcity and even blaming scarcity as a marketing method to increase hype momentum by sony i think companies in the capitalist system want to maximize profits asap in the case of gaming consoles game companies want to establish a fanbase for their consoles as soon as possible so they can leverage it selling more subscriptions contracting developers with exclusives and so on moreover in these sectors the systems are generally selling at loss at launch precisely to acquire a base as soon as possible scalpers are more of a symptom and not the cause in my opinion we don t see scalpers scalping lego or random tv s even in these strange covid times this leads to my main point what we witness here the limits we experience with production of the most complex luxury parts of equipment we use is a harbinger of less and lesser complex production of equipment as productions hits newer lows it s a matter of time scalpers will show up and buying up watercookers microwaves and stuff below that

1,i feel like the pandemic has fundamentally broken something in my worldview maybe this should be from a throwaway account but i can t help but feel like something in the last year has broken my brain i ve always been pretty cynical about capitalism and modernity and i won t say that any of the craziness qanon anti maskers reactionary violence was necessarily surprising to me but nevertheless seeing it playing out live was so much worse than talking about it i can t shake this pervasive feeling that something catastrophic is coming and that in some nebulous lovecraftian way it already exists out there in some sense trying to focus on day to day necessities like school work seems weirdly pointless kind of like i feel almost see through if i stood in front of the sun it would go right through me everything feels trivial the thing that my eyes were opened to this year is so much bigger both compelling and horrifying does anyone else feel this way

1,how could you guys bait and switch on the capitol riots like that politics are our true  politics are funny they tear friends and families apart and both sides claim the other side is evil and refuse to find a common ground on anything and i d like to say in my personal opinion that politics have been the reason for the true decline of america as a country gt anything can become political even climate change which is beyond me as it s been decades in the making but politics have got in the way of any progress but what will forever grind my gears is this i recall when the capitol riots happened many high ranking republican conservative leaders mayors and officials were all condemning it as a violent act many also turned on trump at the time suddenly not even less than a month later those same people that were condemning it and saying those are extremists that don t represent us are now saying oh we fully support them they done nothing wrong how can you just switch and lie to everyone even your own people like that was it for a publicity stunt being the reason you lied so you wouldn t lose your job or face controversy understandable and i will applaud you for the playing the game of politics like that that is indeed a smart move regardless of what side you re on democratic or republican it s obvious there were people in that crowd that really intended to hurt people inside of the building and even several or a conservative official was inside that same building whose life was in danger too how can we say even if we disagree with the other person s politics we should respect them when several people were intending to kill or hold hostage those same very people whose politics they disagree with see folks politics are bringing out the worst of us causing us to hurt people we may not agree with let s find a common ground i ll start i think both sides can agree that chocolate tastes good

1,people s reaction when the electricity comes back on i find this fascinating from the silence during the blackout the two young men looking around when crossing the road looks like confusion but is probably just them looking for traffic to the mass not quite hysteria but group arms in the air celebration with screams and cheers in the distance it is indicative of how and why people simply do not want to consider what has to be done to minimise the damage caused by environmental destruction claimate change they want to be all watched over by machines of loving grace they appear pretty fucking helpless in anything that might approach a crisis
1,what is to be done i ve already been through the stages of grief i despaired bargained with myself and others denied the hopelessness of it all and i m now on the other side acceptance i m not stressed about what is coming what can happen will happen that said what is to be done from an individual standpoint the answer seems clear work towards total self sustainability grow your own food generate your own power have a reliable source of water draw those you care about closer trim away the unnecessary social fat from your life if you have kids raise them to understand the situation and be adaptable and pragmatic if you don t have kids you need to have an honest discussion with yourself over whether or not having one is a good idea convert as much of your wealth into physical necessities as you can stock up on things that might be hard to get once shtf learn to defend yourself buy weapon if possible don t tell anyone about your planning loose lips sink ships all it takes is one of your friends gossiping about how you re a paranoid hoarder and you could find yourself a target once supplies start to run out now all of that is comparatively easy your own situation is within your control what is to be done about everyone else do we join protests try to stir up change back when i was in university this seemed tempting for how else can the people effect change without massing and demanding it nowadays i feel differently the best we can expect from a protest is a placebo from the elites the illusion that things are heading in a better direction now some of you might point to countries in the middle east that overthrew their governments after extensive protests the arab spring is that not real change it is sure bit are they truly better off for it if you liposuction out the flabby fat from a morbidly obese man he is still left with diabetes and ravenous hunger it s not long before those skin flaps are filled again those who rise to the top in a broken system often find themselves falling to the same vices are those who preceded them corruption is inevitable name me one advances society that has resisted corruption and treated it s citizens equally and fairly i would love to eat my words but over time the true visionaries die and those who come next never fill their shoes hard times beget strong men hard men make good times good times beget weak men weak men make hard times not an exact quote but the point still stands those protesters on the street right now might be filled with the vigor of righteousness the desire to see things change but what happens once they get it they topple the oligarchy bring about a new golden age of equality and tolerance and then that will just continue forever that is of course completely ignoring the elephant in the room how the hell are a bunch of placard wavers ever going to topple the us government a militarized police force and the world s most fearsome armed forces are propping up the house of cards i don t see them switching sides so protesting is out i don t want to be stung with rubber bullets sprayed with pepper spray locked away and put on a watchlist so how about change from within find a strong political candidate raise awareness take on the powers that be at the polling stations i can hear your collective eyes rolling in your sockets as we speak that is a fool s errand anyone who threatens to change the status quo and gains enough popular support will find the full weight of the elites against them so let s make our own pacs pool our resources and hire lobbyists beat them at their own game when then do we sell out we need to shake hands with people who disgust us morally we need to take money from the very people we were fighting against in the first place if we want to get a foot in the door to get to where they are you need to be who they are ruthless power hungry and self serving so what the hell are we to do is running away from it all throwing our hands up in resignation the only option let the masses and police fight in the streets let the elites keep on destroying the planet it s too late to stop them anyway just find your own little place of peace and do your best to ride out the storm i want to hear your perspectives i want to know what can be done what needs to be done

1, is not a problem to be solved it is an intractable predicament with consequences that must be endured shoutout to u animals are dumb for giving me words to express my frustration with the level of discourse here when i talk about human overshoot the precursor to  i am talking about an issue with no morally justifiable solution i don t suggest a solution i just want people to recognize that our overwhelming presence on this planet threatens the ecosystem that we depend on our overwhelming success is ironically an existential threat to our species just like it would be to any other it s too late to solve this problem in any humane manner we shouldn t be so bold to think we could maybe the time for anthropocentric hubris has passed the best thing we can do is let it shake out how it will and hope that some human life and wilderness will be left when the die off ends we cannot stop the inevitable die off and bottleneck the best thing we can do is help the wilderness be strong however we can but what goes up will come down what is overshot will  and our infrastructure that allows these numbers to exist is only getting weaker sorry but stopping this train from crashing only delays and worsens the inevitable overpopulation is real as fuck and is sustained by fossil fuels and mineral resources and the over exploitation of renewable resources such as soil wood etc there is no solving this the things that allowed us to balloon to this level we will soon not be able to rely on like we once did so when i talk about overpopulation i am not promoting or talking about eugenics or anything sinister in that vein i am talking about a basic ecological mechanism that i am afraid we cannot and will not escape the consequences of hunker down folks

1,thoughts on moving northward as global warming continues to shift regional temperatures higher hello r  currently my so and i live in the mid atlantic region of the us and we are trying to actively plan out a future where we homestead and are self sufficient throughout our discussions i ve tried to emphasize that global warming is going to shift local climates and make the farther north more habitable in the long term however my so is dead set on moving south to a currently warmer climate without any consideration of the long term repercussions on this decision what are your thoughts on long term survival climate location planning as ecological  is hastened do you think moving northward is a valid thought how about moving to the global south like new zealand or south america if you had unlimited resources what would be your ideal location to live in a drastically warmer world

1,how the us economy will thrive on the expense of the rest of the world s economies tl dr for the first article all the economic indicators are showing the us economy is doing great tl dr for the second article the total income and wealth for the very wealthy is rising so high that it is more than enough to cover the stagnant wages for most people and chinese and other countries wealthier customers are buying enough amazon com johnson and johnson disney nike facebook google and the consumer staples and consumer discretionary etfs to cover the non spending of poorer american ex middle class in addition us has a virtual monopoly on scientific progress with a few european nations playing second fiddle and us productivity has skyrocketed although wages have stayed the same in short the entire world s economy is supporting the wealthy of america because that s how the world is going foreign money prop up the plum real estate of america although that will not help the boarded up dwellings in slums or meth country the world s money flees for safety and usa s plum areas will remain safer than virtually everywhere on earth so that s where the world s wealthy is parking their money gt but because the economic contributions of cognitive and finance elite are so substantial the pareto principle implies that the economy can keep expanding even as so many feel and are stuck and this is how it s possible to be optimistic about america technological progress and the s amp p despite all the negativity

1,a possible  of governments replaced by corporations the broken world in the late s europe found itself at a crossroads its economy never truly recovered from the massive financial crisis the impact of which was made considerably worse by european union governments being completely detached from their voter base and the reality of daily life in most european cities while the united states adapted to the situation and leaned more towards isolationism europe chose to keep its borders open leading to the arrival of millions of refugees from the war torn middle east despite warnings from all major militaries and police forces unwilling to accept the reality of new security risks the passivity and indecisiveness of european governments led to the worst series of terrorist attacks in history culminating in the detonation of two dirty nuclear devices on the outskirts of paris and berlin while the casualty rate was relatively light the sight of massive atomic like explosions and the subsequent news reports of victims dead or dying from radiation sparked a revolution of the kind europe had never seen in its modern history the united states managed to avoid such attacks but the american economy also suffered with the southern states ravaged by what eventually grew into a full scale war with militias and terrorist groups backed by drug cartels now fully in charge of several south american countries and emboldened by the perceived weakness of the west in the wake of the attacks the european union became completely paralyzed as all traditional political parties  virtually overnight burned away by the fires of people s rage populist leaders rose to power with promises to end corruption solve the constant state of crisis and make europe safe again backed by unprecedented popular support a massive hunt for the culprits began by the time it ended two years later thousands of formerly untouchable political figures bankers or businessmen had been found guilty of contributing to the state of the world and executed or sentenced to life in prison but for all their momentary support the revolution leaders could only ride the popularity wave so far and the economic situation just kept getting worse many economic structures had been damaged beyond recovery factories had been looted and closed down the infrastructure suffering from years of neglect while most european countries avoided complete  practically every advanced country in the world saw its situation worsen with the biggest burden of funding cuts crushing the weakest members of society the sick and the elderly the worsening healthcare and social service situation led to further riots that threatened to destroy the last vestiges of stability that europe and north america clung to and in their desperation the leaders turned to corporations hammering the last nail into the coffin of the old world rise of the corporations the largest corporations in the world survived the entire european crisis relatively unscathed due to their global nature many of their leaders in fact exploited the chaos secretly fueling unrest to give them a better bargaining position when the dust settled many of the largest companies found themselves richer than the traditional countries attempts to rein them in and tax them just kept failing because of the sheer amount of power and wealth they wielded any court proceedings were blocked by obstructions taxmen were paid off and any politician that tried to impose new corporate rules quickly found his opposition suddenly receiving a massive monetary influx in their desperation european leaders traded the only thing they had left for bailouts and relief to the beleaguered countries rights privileges and land within a few short years entire regions were sold off as private property in exchange for financial aid and every such step only made corporations stronger and countries weaker the process culminated in the signing of the bordeaux treaty granting most major corporations complete exemption from local legal and tax systems including local constitutions and allowing them to form private armies and police forces territories owned by corporations were known by the term corporate space and they became independent countries in all but name sustained by trade and business wealth while countries withered away from lack of revenue and stability this naturally caused hundreds of thousands of citizens to flock towards corporate space but those hoping for a piece of their old life quickly found that this was not how things worked anymore in corporate space the principle of citizenship was replaced by a contract between the corporation and its subject these contracts were often extremely restrictive with the corporate subject giving up most basic rights such as free speech the freedom to assemble or the right for political representation and agreeing to become company workforce for an undetermined period of time in exchange for the promise of food and shelter these contracts became known as indentured service a modern version of slavery ruthless corporate security forces hunted down malcontents and dissidents when caught anyone resisting the company was deported from its territory or worse in the months following the signing of the bordeaux treaty tens of thousands of people labeled security risks disappeared completely their fate unknown and so millions of people found themselves in a totalitarian world that they could not have imagined in their worst nightmares corporate armies and mercenaries after the bordeaux treaty each major corporation established a military branch usually based on its own security service and staffed by former professional soldiers mercenaries and killers while some of these units respected the basic laws of civilized warfare others such as the clayburn industries crimson reavers became infamous for their brutality and ruthlessness faced with the need to protect their own assets and with traditional armies and police forces unable to protect them anymore smaller corporations and countries came together and after many months of negotiation agreed upon the private military treaty a multilateral contract defining the conditions of establishing running and employing private military forces available for hire a legal private military force had to be registered in istanbul which subsequently became known as the mercenary city and was subject to a number of restrictions that included a wmd ownership ban and a uniform code of conduct prohibiting battlefield cruelty and attacks against civilians any forces not adhering to the code were not recognized as official pmcs regardless of their size and were usually given no quarter in battle after the complete annihilation of several such warbands during the bloody operation sentinel in kenya many pmcs bent on exploiting the situation came around and subjected themselves to treaty registration freedom at a price still there were those who would not submit for any number of reasons some hated what the world had become some wanted to be the new world s freedom fighters and some simply wanted to be left alone these men and women were drawn to the areas of the world that the old nations were unable to control and the new corporations were not interested in these areas eventually became known as badlands with the biggest such areas located in the american southwest north western china and central africa occasional corporate attempts to annex these areas invariably led to a quick capture followed by a protracted guerrilla war that ended in massive corporate force losses making the corporation pull out as there was no profit in controlling such an unstable territory as the s entered their second half an uneasy balance was achieved between countries and corporations but corporate greed knows no limits and dozens of freedom fighter groups criminal organizations and deadly cults are spawned every year it is only a question of time before the world is plunged into the chaos of war once more source

1,the insanity of the rich what is maybe shocking to majority of people is that we are basically ruled by bunch of totally mad people the now space travelling billionaire class is full of mentality that can be only considered to be delusional sociopathic and even psychotic people like jeff bezos bill gates and richard branson aren t ok their whole worldview is full of things that we would consider to be sign of mental illness of personality disorder the peak of their insanity is their current dreams of space colonization they believe that they can be leaders who guide humanity to a new cosmic era the billionaires don t see themselves just as powerful or influential they are beginning to see themselves as gods they are spending millions into a research of anti aging and immortality in their twisted and crazy minds they can achieve it all nobody tells them that they can t do it they have surrounded themselves with group of paid people who tell them whatever they want to hear they have their own court which fuels their insanity in some ways this situation is similar to what was going on old monarchies right before their fall kings and queens of the old times believed that they were chosen by god and like billionaires of today they also spent their money on grandiose projects that were often completely impossible and when they had almost unlimited power they spent the money of the people just for their own amusement we need to look the rich as not just evil but also as mentally troubled they are greedy people who believe that once they have destroyed the whole planet for profit they can reach into space and also impose their will there they don t care about the rest of humanity we are just mindless masses in their eyes that can be sacrificed or they want to enslave us totally through technology whatever serves their agenda is fine for them because if you believe that you are an actual god you believe that you can t be wrong i believe that when jeff bezos looks into mirror he sees nothing wrong he probably can t admit that what he is doing is causing the destruction of earth the fact that in this system completely insane people can have largest fortunes and through that massive amounts of power shows that the system is broken and can t be fixed no laws can fix things since the billionaires live above every legal system you will never see elon musk in prison the only thing that can actually bring justice is a revolution all the property of the rich corrupted elites has to be distributed to the people if you are insane and delusional you shouldn t be able to be the richest person alive there is no more justification for the existence of the global elites and their political lackeys their pathological system and control over us has to end it doesn t solve entire climate change but it is justice even during the worst times humanity needs justice swift justice not boring endless trials and legal cases that only end up in the victory of the elites like the jacobins and the bolsheviks we need to put end to the insane rule of the rich that is the only way

1,why is the media deliberately ignoring the deadlier south african virus gt the new variant also appears to affect young people more than before according to mkhize clinicians have noticed a shift in the clinical epidemiological picture in particular noting that they are seeing more young people with no co morbidities presenting with critical illness there was also a twitter thread from a doctor confirming this but i can t find it now so why is the media silent about this it has to be deliberate because the news covid strain causes more severe illness in young people would be headline gold the fact that i have heard nothing about it from mainstream outlets means its absence must be deliberate
1,are there any good what would it take articles on how much we d have to change our world to actually have a fighting chance googling didn t help much i m not looking for how much can we pollute and raw numbers but rather a visualization of how a world where we actually fought climate change would look like and preferably with a realistic spin rather than the utopian one like that life would be very different from our current one we d have to give up most of our meat consumption basically all of our jobs the internet and maybe a story time of what daily life would be in that world if it exists
1,if all energy is free what s money how many times have you heard the free energy term but think about it the fossil fuels were just sitting there all along sunlight wind tidal wave is free energy in effect any energy source is derived from the sun is free you disagree try this the sun blinks out now you have about mins of old sunlight then we all die all that energy is free thanks to our local working fusion reactor the sun or are you going to say the people worked to extract those fossil fuels well initially they didn t it was sitting around in pools stinking the place up or we now need metals and machines to extract it and those took work and energy to make and all of that work and energy came from where men gt food gt sunlight machines gt fossil fuels gt old sunlight energy source the free sun so what s money it just seems to be a way to barter for different things that we created with free energy so is money really a measure of time used by people arguably geothermal does not come from the sun but without the sun that geothermal would have dissipated a lot quicker and we wouldn t be here anyway and would the earth have formed without the sun so moot point

1,it s a matter of years folks hold these two major stories in your head at the same time from nature three years to safeguard our climate gt at the current emission rate of gt of co per year the lower limit of this range would be crossed in years and the midpoint of gt of co would be passed in years if the current rate of annual emissions stays at this level we would have to drop them almost immediately to zero once we exhaust the budget such a jump to distress is in no one s interest a more gradual descent would allow the global economy time to adapt smoothly and this from the chicago tribune coal on the rise in china u s india after major drop gt coal consumption will continue to increase mainly driven by asian countries zhou said we re seeing a recovery starting this year and an increase until the mid s before you see coal plateau globally more gt despite the announced cancellation or suspension of coal plants others remain under construction meaning consumption of coal for power will continue to rise zhou said indonesia malaysia vietnam and pakistan also are building new plants gt in india where percent of electricity comes from coal production has long been increasing in defiance of global trends the country has long argued it has both a right and an obligation to expand power generation as it extends electricity access to hundreds of millions of people who still have none india also is seeking to reduce its reliance on imported coal by mining more of its own reserves gt an ap review of reports from the coal ministry of india found that mining among state owned companies which comprise the overwhelming majority of the nation s production grew percent in the first five months of this year in short scientists are saying we must be on the downward curve for emissions by because peaking at would be an economic catastrophe while at the same time projections for coal are expected to rise through perhaps this is too obvious but we are halfway through and co level acceleration is smashing records there is no guardrail the guardrail is gone we are pushing harder on the gas as we get closer to the curve scientific charts and international agreements haven t stopped the acceleration in years they ain t going to reinvent the foundations of our economy in years

1,bleak bau scenario from deep green resistance gt if there is no substantive resistance likely there will be a few more years of business as usual though with increasing economic disrup tion and upset according to the best available data the impacts of peak oil start to hit somewhere between and resulting in a rapid decline in global energy availability it s possible that this may happen slightly later if all out attempts are made to extract remaining fossil fuels but that would only prolong the inevitable worsen global warming and make the eventual decline that much steeper and more severe once peak oil sets in the increasing cost and decreasing supply of energy undermines manufacturing and transportation especially on a global scale gt the energy slide cause economic turmoil and a self perpetuating cycle of economic contraction will take place businesses will be unable to pay their workers workers will be unable to buy things and more companies will shrink or go out of business and will be unable to pay their workers unable to pay their debts and mortgages homeowners companies and even states will go bankrupt it s possible that this process has already begun international trade will nosedive because of a global depression and increasing transportation and manufacturing costs though it s likely that the price of oil increase over time there will be times when the contracting economy causes falling demand for oil thus suppressing the price the lower cost of oil may ironically but beneficially limit investment in new oil infrastructure gt at first the  will resemble a traditional recession or depression with the poor being hit especially hard by the increasing costs of basic goods particularly of electricity and heating in cold areas after a few years the financial limits will become physical ones large scale energy intensive manufacturing will become not only uneconomical but impossible gt a direct result of this will be the  of industrial agriculture dependent on vast amounts of energy for tractor fuel synthesized pes ticides and fertilizers irrigation greenhouse heating packaging and transportation global industrial agriculture will run up against hard limits to production driven at first by intense competition for energy from other sectors this will be worsened by the depletion of ground water and aquifers a long history of soil erosion and the early stages of climate change at first this will cause a food and economic crisis mostly felt by the poor over time the situation will worsen and indus trial food production will fall below that required to sustain the population gt there will be three main responses to this global food shortage in some areas people will return to growing their own food and build sus tainable local food initiatives this will be a positive sign but public involvement will be belated and inadequate as most people still won t have caught on to the permanency of  and won t want to have to grow their own food it will also be made far more difficult by the massive urbanization that has occurred in the last century by the destruction of the land and by climate change furthermore most sub sistence cultures will have been destroyed or uprooted from their land land inequalities will hamper people from growing their own food just as they do now in the majority of the world without well organized resisters land reform will not happen and displaced people will not be able to access land as a result widespread hunger and starvation worsening to famine in bad agricultural years will become endemic in many parts of the world the lack of energy for industrial agriculture will cause a resurgence in the institutions of slavery and serfdom gt slavery does not occur in a political vacuum threatened by eco nomic and energy  some governments will fall entirely turning into failed states with no one to stop them warlords will set up shop in the rubble others desperate to maintain power against emboldened secessionists and civil unrest will tum to authoritarian forms of government in a world of diminishing but critical resources governments will get leaner and meaner we will see a resurgence of authoritari anism in modem forms technofascism and corporation feudalism the rich will increasingly move to private and well defended enclaves their country estates will not look apocalyptic they will look like eco edens with well tended organic gardens clean private lakes and wildlife refuges in some cases these enclaves will be tiny and in others they could fill entire countries gt meanwhile the poor will see their own condition worsen the mil lions of refugees created by economic and energy  will be on the move but no one will want them in some brittle areas the influx of refugees will overwhelm basic services and cause a local  resulting in cascading waves of refugees radiating from  and dis aster epicenters in some areas refugees will be turned back by force of arms in other areas racism and discrimination will come to the fore as an excuse for authoritarians to put marginalized people and dissidents in special settlements leaving more resources for the privileged des perate people will be the only candidates for the dangerous and dirty manual labor required to keep industrial manufacturing going once the energy supply dwindles hence those in power will consider autonomous and self sustaining communities a threat to their labor supply and suppress or destroy them gt despite all of this technological progress will not yet stop for a time it will continue in fits and starts although humanity will be split into increasingly divergent groups those on the bottom will be unable to meet their basic subsistence needs while those on the top will attempt to live lives of privilege as they had in the past even seeing some technological advancements many of which will be intended to cement the superiority of those in power in an increasingly crowded and hostile world gt technofascists will develop and perfect social control technologies already currently in their early stages autonomous drones for surveil lance and assassination microwave crowd control devices mri assisted brain scans that allow for infallible lie detection even mind reading and torture there will be no substantive organized resistance in this scenario but in each year that passes the technofascists make them selves more and more able to destroy resistance even in its smallest expression as time slips by the window of opportunity for resistance will swiftly close technofascists of the early to mid twenty first century will have technology for coercion and surveillance that will make the most practiced of the stasi or the ss look like rank amateurs their ability to debase humanity will make their predecessors appear saintly by comparison gt not all governments will take this turn of course but the authori tarian governments those that will continue ruthlessly exploiting people and resources regardless of the consequences will have more sway and more muscle and will take resources from their neighbors and failed states as they please there will be no one to stop them it won t matter if you are the most sustainable eco village on the planet if you live next door to an eternally resource hungry fascist state gt meanwhile with industrial powers increasingly desperate for energy the tenuous remaining environmental and social regulations will be cast aside the worst of the worst practices like drilling offshore and in wildlife refuges and mountaintop removal for coal will become com monplace these will be merely the dregs of prehistoric energy reserves the drilling will only prolong the endurance of industrial civ ilization for a matter of months or years but ecological damage will be long term or permanent as is happening in the arctic national wildlife refuge because in our scenario there is no substantive resistance this will all proceed unobstructed gt investment in renewable industrial energy will also take place although it will be belated and hampered by economic challenges government bankruptcies and budget cuts furthermore long distance power transmission lines will be insufficient and crumbling from age replacing and upgrading them will prove difficult and expensive as result even once in place electric renewables will only produce a fraction of the energy produced by petroleum that electric energy will not be suitable to run the vast majority of tractors trucks and other vehicles or similar infrastructure gt as a consequence renewable energy will have only a minimal moderating effect on the energy cliff in fact the energy invested in the new infrastructure will take years to pay itself back with electricity gener ated massive infrastructure upgrades will actually steepen the energy cliff by decreasing the amount of energy available for daily activities there will be a constant struggle to allocate limited supplies of energy under successive crises there will be some rationing to prevent riots but most energy regardless of the source will go to governments the military corporations and the rich gt energy constraints will make it impossible to even attempt any full scale infrastructure overhauls like hydrogen economies which wouldn t solve the problem anyway biofuels will take off in many areas despite the fact that they mostly have a poor ratio of energy returned on energy invested eroei the eroei will be better in trop ical countries so remaining tropical forests will be massively logged to clear land for biofuel production often forests will be logged en masse simply to burn for fuel heavy machinery will be too expensive for most plantations so their labor will come from slavery and serfdom under authoritarian governments and corporate feudalism slavery is currently used in brazil to log forests and produce charcoal by hand for the steel industry after all the global effects of biofuel production will be increases in the cost of food increases in water and irrigation drawdown for agriculture and worsening soil erosion regardless its production will amount to only a small fraction of the liquid hydrocarbons available at the peak of civilization gt all of this will have immediate ecological consequences the oceans wracked by increased fishing to compensate for food shortages and warming induced acidity and coral die offs will be mostly dead the expansion of biofuels will destroy many remaining wild areas and global biodiversity will plummet tropical forests like the amazon produce the moist climate they require through their own vast transpiration but expanded logging and agriculture will cut transpiration and tip the bal ance toward permanent drought even where the forest is not actually cut the drying local climate will be enough to kill it the amazon will turn into a desert and other tropical forests will follow suit gt projections vary but it s almost certain that if the majority of the remaining fossil fuels are extracted and burned global warming would become self perpetuating and catastrophic however the worst effects will not be felt until decades into the future once most fossil fuels have already been exhausted by then there will be very little energy or industrial capacity left for humans to try to compensate for the effects of global warming gt furthermore as intense climate change takes over ecological reme diation through perennial polycultures and forest replanting will become impossible the heat and drought will turn forests into net carbon emitters as northern forests die from heat pests and disease and then burn in continent wide fires that will make early twenty first century conflagrations look minor even intact pastures won t survive the temperature extremes as carbon is literally baked out of remaining agricultural soils gt resource wars between nuclear states will break out war between the us and russia is less likely than it was in the cold war but ascending superpowers like china will want their piece of the global resource pie nuclear powers such as india and pakistan will be densely populated and ecologically precarious climate change will dry up major rivers previously fed by melting glaciers and hundreds of millions of people in south asia will live bare meters above sea level with few resources to equip and field a mechanized army or air force nuclear strikes will seem an increasingly effective action for desperate states gt if resource wars escalate to nuclear wars the effects will be severe even in the case of a minor nuclear war between countries like india and pakistan even if each country uses only fifty hiroshima sized bombs as air bursts above urban centers a nuclear winter will result although lethal levels of fallout last only a matter of weeks the ecological effects will be far more severe the five megatons of smoke pro duced will darken the sky around the world stratospheric heating will destroy most of what remains of the ozone layer in contrast to overall warming trend a little ice age will begin immediately and last for several years during that period temperatures in major agricultural regions will routinely drop below freezing in summer massive and immediate starvation will occur around the world gt that s in the case of a small war the explosive power of one hundred hiroshima sized bombs accounts for only percent of the global arsenal if a larger number of more powerful bombs are used or if cobalt bombs are used to produce long term irradiation and wipe out surface life the effects will be even worse there will be few human survivors the nuclear winter effect will be temporary but the bombing and subsequent fires will put large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere kill plants and impair photosynthesis as a result after the ash settles global warming will be even more rapid and worse than before gt nuclear war or not the long term prospects are dim global warming will continue to worsen long after fossil fuels are exhausted for the planet the time to ecological recovery is measured in tens of millions of years if ever as james lovelock has pointed out a major warming event could push the planet into a different equilibrium one much warmer than the current one it s possible that large plants and ani mals might only be able to survive near the poles it s also possible that the entire planet could become essentially uninhabitable to large plants and animals with a climate more like venus than earth gt all that is required for this to occur is for current trends to continue without substantive and effective resistance all that is required for evil to succeed is for good

1,anyone else notice our culture s distinct lack of interest in kids we all know the cliche won t somebody think of the children but seriously does anybody give two shits about kids these days when was the last time you really saw children given the spotlight politics startups technology drugs conflict all shoved down our throats on a daily basis yet when it comes to the people who literally represent the future of humanity nothing out of sight out of mind right except even when kids are relevant they get ignored school shooting fanfare goes to guns media about how strong and important mothers are apparently more important than the kids they raise abortion life is precious until it can no longer be used as a political prop it s as if our culture goes out of its way to minimize the most valuable resource we have and not only do we not pay attention to children we lock them away in prisons until they are old enough to not be special anymore at which point they are already burnt out and straddled with debt from an education that taught them nothing does this not seem a bit odd if you don t believe me do a search on the topic in fact do a search on kids in general here are some interesting results the perfect example of using children as props the author asserts that we don t really care about our children and then proves her point by using a school shooting as a way to talk about public health women babies car crashes and guns the comments section further reflects this mentality basically everything matters except the actual kids california passed a law to protect child actors but everyone ignores it because nobody enforces it people care more about protecting their data which they purposely make public than protecting children

1,let s try to decipher trump s actions regarding iran and the iranian response so trump assassinated qassem soleimani the nd in command in iran he was an incredible figure who rose from a working class background to become the nd most powerful man in the most powerful country in the middle east his father was a construction worker and he would work with him in his spare time he d lift weights then the iran iraq war broke out and he enlisted to defend his country he swiftly rose through the ranks and became an officer soon he became the commander of quds force and oversaw shiite resistance against israel in lebanon and palestine in coordination with hezbollah during his long career he led the northern alliance to victory against the taliban led hezbollah to victory over israel in the war led iraqi armies in the defense of baghdad against isis defeated isis in syria defeated the saudis in yemen and was more or less the supreme commander of all anti zionist forces in the middle east as the sun uk said he was erwin rommel james bond and lady gaga all put into one i personally would not mind such a man as king or dictator the question is why trump had him assassinated according to the iraqi pm soleimani was carrying a letter detailing a plan to deescalate with saudi arabia at the behest of trump apparently trump asked the iraqi pm to make overtures to tehran and soleimani was there to negotiate if this is true then it means that trump set him up and dishonorably betrayed the trust of iran and his iraqi allies israel also recently tried and failed to assassinate soleimani and more or less admits that it wanted the us to take care of it in fear of blow back but why did trump take this action which it seems only harms us and even israeli interests in the region the whole world even american allies in the eu are condemning this and this type of blatant violation of international law further reduced trust in the us turkey is already veering towards russia and china and this will cause iran to further embrace the new sino russian axis they are now holding the first ever sino russo iranian joint naval drills in the persian gulf this also more or less permanently ends any prospect of peace with iran obama and the neoliberal faction of the elite wished for peace with iran and thus signed the nuclear deal even after trump and his neocon faction pulled the plug on the deal there was some lingering hope that a rapprochement would be possible this assassination of their top general in a civilian aircraft dashes any such hopes not only on a diplomatic front such an action is not even helpful on the military front soleimani was a great man but no one in the military is irreplaceable he will soon be replaced by another general and the policies will continue unabated if anything this shuts down all pro western factions in iran permanently and now the regime will increase its military support to hezbollah the houthis and hamas it does not change the strategic or even tactical situation in the slightest the only way iranian resistance or operations against zionism will cease is either if a peace is reached with iran or a complete invasion and overthrow the mullah regime in tehran in anything it deteriorates the situation in the middle east as now iraq is voting to expel us forces from iraq turkey is trying to get rid of the us base in its land and this might embolden russia and china to export high tech weaponry to iran it harms zionists interests in the long run so why did trump do it the answer is more domestic in international trump is facing a difficult reelection with him losing to biden warren and bernie by crushing margins his boomer voter base in the rust belt is dying out and in the swing states he s projecting to lose in he needs funds and the support of the republican establishment now more than ever trump s funding primarily comes from three jewish billionaires sheldon adelson paul singer and bernard marcus three zionist jews pushing for war with iran for ages trump is doing this to please them and gain their money and support for its also a ploy to mobilize his evangelical voter base in the south and to mobilize the neocon boomers that have been programmed to respond positively to us jingoism i think he hopes that an escalated state of tension will mobilize the patriotic vote and get them out in november elections are more often than not won by the candidate that is able to get his voters out on election day rather than the one with the actual popular support it could well be that a surge of boomer voters on election day could override the demographic majority of the democrats whose constituents young people minorities lgbt tend to vote less regularly however this is the standard theory there are more interesting theories as to why trump is doing this right now the first is that they are blackmailing him with impeachment the democrats impeached trump and want to remove him from office however they refused to send the indictment to the senate because they knew the republican senate would acquit him i think trump is being threatened by the zionist billionaires that control the republican part that unless he gives them their war with iran they ll push for the republican senators to join the democrats and remove him from office they d only need to flip republican senators to accomplish this already there are never trump republican senators a little pressure from their zionist donors will easily flip them as for the remaining a combination of media pressure activist pressure donor pressure bribes by adelson singer and marcus in the form of lucrative corporate executive jobs post politics could do the trick if trump is removed from office he ll lose his presidential immunity and could easily be put in jail for numerous charges like tax evasion fraud and conflict of interest while in office he could spend the rest of his life in jail and so might his son donald trump jr in addition to the fact that substantial portions of his wealth might be confiscated so trump is now ratcheting up tensions with iran in order to please the zionist big three adelson is suffering from cancer and wants a war before he dies he apparently is overjoyed that such a long time enemy of israel was murdered this action might just secure his support for that is unless he demands an escalation from trump s point of view its highly strategic an attack like this pleases the zionists and ruins prospects of peace with iran however it is not leading to a full scale war with iran that could lead to a destruction of the saudi oil fields and  of the global economy thus a catastrophic war is not threatening his reelection chances he pleases the zionists he is mobilizing his boomer base and he wards off impeachment then there s the more wacky and unlikely theory that ghislaine maxwell epstein s wife and mistress has compromising material on trump now that she s safely in israel in the care of mossad netanyahu now has complete control over trump netanyahu himself is facing prison time and a war with iran would save his hide for the foreseeable future i personally find this theory less plausible because if they had blackmail on trump it would be in mossad s hand long ago as maxwell and epstein were both mossad agents to start with and as for iran s response i doubt they ll do anything right now the us military is a leviathan that is best avoided for now furthermore they probably realize that an attack on the us military would increase trump s chances at reelection the smart thing for them to do is to wait out till and hope trump gets defeated the zionist faction loses power to the neoliberal faction they might however escalate the conflict against us assets allies and proxies via their proxies like the houthis and hezbollah this would serve their purpose of vengeance and grant them plausible deniability all the while they will most likely further prepare for war by building up their stocks of ballistic and cruise missiles and if possible import some high tech weaponry like asms s s su s and possibly even submarines from russia and china should they be willing to sell them

poisoned for profit we are not the agrochemical industry s guinea pigs why don t americans care about chemicals shit post editorial i can go on all day but you get the point this was one of the easiest research projects i ve done in a while taking about an hour there are at least a chemicals in our environments most of these chemicals leach up the food chain to our bodies all these chemicals interact with each other to compound the ill effects on our bodies why does nobody talk about this because they don t get paid to i don t get paid i do this for fun because i m crazy if i remember correctly there are fertilizers for food but we use only the that make foods grow big and grow fast our green peppers look fantastic but they are devoid of nutritional value not only are they nutritionally empty cosmetically enhanced vacuous shells what little mineral content our bodies may derive from them are blocked by the chemical construction of processed foods it gets worse before we grow our under fertilized foods we genetically alter their essence to withstand massive poisoning by pesticides and herbicides neconics infest every cell of the plant neonic corn seeds must be handled with gloves and are colored blue listen to me if you can t touch a corn seed with your bare hands then there something wrong with most of our food is corn soy wheat and potatoes each of those foods is poisoned beyond repair and nobody knows how these chemicals synergistically destroy our guts and brains because nobody gets paid to after our poisoned seeds are planted in poison soil they are sprayed with poison after the harvest these foods are further poisoned by chemical processing for shelf life once that s done the foods are wrapped in poison and shipped to supermarkets yum yum i can feel my little neurons exploding as i write this smoking weed doesn t help either the microplastics from containers leach into the food for us to eat mmmm but it gets better because we than add a dusting of nano particles to enhance useful properties nano particles also affect neurological health you may have heard that google suppressed the toxic effects of petrochemicals i believe they promote the supposed health benefits of nano particles over their dangers google does this because they are a personal data and advertising company google is the largest media company on earth google news is the same size as the top five news media corporation in the us youtube is owned by google and is the second largest search engine on earth petrochemicals become finished products and finished products buy advertising google is not going to promote something that harms their bottom line you don t need to be a nobel prize winning economist to know this google has the editorial power to swing presidential elections by millions of votes so does facebook do you seriously think our corrupt political system is going to ignore this that s why putting google apple facebook etc in charge of free speech is like putting satan in charge of heaven i speak as an atheist of sorts assuming that everything i said is true do you think google wouldn t facilitate social media influencers to spread disinformation to obfuscate the safety concerns of giant corporations  brought to you by google i m told my awful sense of humor gets in the way of my messaging i don t care if you can t accept what i m saying you

1,naive people are a resource that can be harvested like coal can be mined or forests can be chopped down a naive populace is most easily taken advantage of therefore the leaders try to cultivate certain types of naivete in their populaces over generations example christianity was originally anti state but eventually became incorporated in to the state it preaches dependence on authority and forgiveness and promotes the just world hypothesis this ideology package gives those in authority more credibility and less need to respond to public upset example schools do not teach about credit cards mortgages or any modern useful personal household finance classes despite this being one of the most important things in people s lives it s ignored yet everyone is required to take other classes that are of questionable value this makes them easy to sell loans to because they won t realize the full implications of what they re getting themselves in to imagine how differently the student loan crisis would be going if everyone understood beforehand that the debt was non dischargable through bankruptcy and is a profit center for the federal government who owns around of all student loans to be fair it s obviously good for the public to be smart about certain things because that makes them useful tools of the power structure like how to drive a car read and write and do basic math they want them smart enough to run the machines but not smart enough to question the system however people get abused by this system and people who are abused in a deep way generally do not forget the way in which they were wronged and these lessons can linger in the culture for generations this is what the powerful few would like to break us of they want us to forget the lessons from the past so they can pull the same tricks again a few decades later to gain even more power for themselves so the solution is rather than to put our children and ourselves in a information cocoon of protected innocence and naivete we need to be talking about these dirty undersides of society and reality instead of having them be a surprise when we re fucked by the workforce at age or lose retirement benefits at age because they pull the rug out from under you for profit this should not be the surprise that it is for most people it happens to i don t know why society hides these things instead of exposing them it makes sense on the personal level to hide this stuff so it doesn t hurt your career and then the media ignores it because the corporations doing it are affiliated with the media corporations or at best the share the same corporatist world view and will therefore downplay any negative effects of the design of our capitalist system like the ability to pull the rug out from under people for profit without consequences as long as you word the document correctly legalism has hijacked justice away from the intent toward the printed letter of course things have changed from how they were a few decades ago but the cushiness of the economic atmosphere in the us from the s to s created a generation of parents who created a generation or two of naive children who are now being massively exploited by government taken over by corporations that gets little pushback because the populace are like children concerned about sports superhero movies and their personal consumerism rather than the creeping systemic issues that make life difficult for everyone we could easily fix these things if everyone cared but they don t because they re naive they can get away with living in their little bubbles because reality doesn t actually butt in to say otherwise we ve internalized this tactic for years now and certain narratives like work hard and you can buy your own house have become worn completely thin and mean next to nothing anymore but for a large chunk of the us population it has been that way for their entire lifetime and they have trouble realizing it is not that way anymore until it affects them or their family directly these economic mantras are a religion and they come from a naivete that was cultivated through rosy economic conditions but now we re backed in to a corner and people have forgotten how to push back in an effective way they ve forgotten how to trust each other to accomplish something for the people rather than just their race or their gender or whatever subgroup they ve been effectively divided and conquered in to we can fix it but we re just waiting for enough people to be affected to start caring again i bet systemic corruption would suddenly become a forefront issue if there was another style economic crash however with the mainstream media playing pied piper with all types of media which now includes their gaming of internet comments and votes people are easily mislead in to foolish narratives that serve the ruling structure we can wake up or we can keep sleeping it s just a matter of what narratives we choose to spread we can cultivate naivete to be exploited by the ruling structure or we can extinguish naivete by spreading wisdom uncomfortable truths are only uncomfortable because we have such artificially inflated expectations in the first place thanks to false narratives that promote certain power structures if our culture told the truth to the children and to each other we wouldn t live in this fake bubble culture after a few decades

1,lag in feedback from loss of arctic sea ice albedo this is probably obvious to many of you but i was comparing the decline of arctic sea ice volume with the decline in extent and noticed how much more significant the decline in volume has been for both summer minimums and winter maximums this makes sense since ice has to thin before it breaks up but it also means something for the feedback that kicks in with the loss of albedo if a blue ocean event were to occur before as the piomas trend suggests is very possible we would loose as much summer arctic sea ice extent in the next years as we did in the previous years in other words the feedback from loss of albedo lags far behind the loss of sea ice volume i have no way to quantify what this means for warming but maybe some of you have a better idea
1,how did you learn about  and come to the realization that  was more or less inevitable  is a pretty fringe view at least in my experience so i m curious how everyone else got led to it and first responded to it personally researching climate change brought me down a rabbit hole of the unsustainable exploitation of the planet the more i researched the more dire it seemed i won t list everything because there s a lot but to me the logical conclusion was and is that there really is no chance at our business as usual state that we don t  unless we get some major tech ex machina and a lot of luck i ve come to accept it and feel fortunate i m living in the pinnacle of human technology and entertainment still it s hard not to see everything as petty compared to 
1,the apocalypse has hit you have one hour to assemble your six person survival team with the caveat that everyone else is trying to do the same whom do you choose it is relatively trivial for one to conceive of an ideal group of survivalists when acting as if only oneself has foreknowledge of the  event this thought experiment questions instead who you know you can rely upon not only for their skills but also for their availability and mutual desire to band together with you consider your ex army neighbor is probably a good choice in isolation but the selection pressure from his family or fellow veterans will most likely outweigh yours the rationale more than any hidden stash of food or weapons a cache of individuals with the right balance of independence from others and commitment to you would be the most invaluable resource in a fluid dangerous situation also i realize is an arbitrary sized band but many more and group politics comes into play feel free as well to replace human companions with animals
1, vs transitional change hey all forgive the barely coherent rant in advance long time lurker sometimes commenter first time poster i don t really feel my voice will always necessarily add value to these conversations so i generally abide by a principle of reading the thoughts of others and synthesizing my own views with no specific end in mind other than to further my own understanding with that being said my impression of the present state of the human condition is that it has reached some kind of ambiguous inflection point we find ourselves again in my view at a point in human history where we have the rare opportunity to bend the curve of progress either to our favor or to our detriment if i am being forthright it appears to me that the overall trajectory of humanity has been on a steep decline for the past several centuries this isn t to say that our population technology average wellbeing or whatever other measurable metric has not trended upward as i believe that those all have the average human being today has access to miracles of technology undreamt of by our ancestors we have reduced human suffering on a broader scale than ever known and we have become the masters of our collective fate still we have never been in more peril than i feel we are today except perhaps when there were only very few of us this is an existential peril that can only be understood when considering the whole arc of humanity s existence not that i claim to grasp the full and complete history of our species or to be capable of foretelling our ultimate fate but that is why i am writing this i don t know what the future holds for us i don t know if it will be bad or good truth be told i ve always been more on the side of considering our biggest existential threat climate change as an impetus for change a call to arms that we can rise to answer most disheartening for me has been seeing the overriding influence of greed shackling us to the fate of a miserable and abrupt end perhaps we will never overcome the basest instincts of our nature the greed and the lying and our meager capacity to grasp anything outside of a small and narrow focus do all of these pressures boil down to some kind of solvable bargaining problem who s to say i think that we have it within us to change and to avoid  entirely however it requires cooperation and the general understanding that the cooperation is not only necessary but incontrovertibly beneficial and i think this most recent pandemic has shown that that can be possible shelter in place measures have shown that the human race is capable of global coordinated change for the common good at least broadly speaking where we have failed is we have established systems that by their very design ensure that there will always be outliers that are not cared for within our societies my proposition to humanity would be to systematically eliminate the underlying conditions that cause these outliers to exist this in lieu of hoping that the tug of war between influences for incremental positive change and influences detrimental to the collective whole will eventually result in a net positive i don t think that the current processes can or that even if they could that they could do so in a small enough timescale what exactly do we as individuals do though our individual private decisions pale in comparison to the juggernauts of industry and commerce that our world is fundamentally built to rely upon our decisions to recycle to balance our production and consumption to act politically and to make the world better can not succeed in the face of a world designed for their failure what is the point of donating vast sums to alleviating problems without addressing the systems they resulted from bill gates can funnel all of his income and capital toward solving these issues but even a hundred of him would only amount to a little dutch boy with his finger in the dam but for each hole he plugs three others will sprout so here is my pedestrian thought after lots of reading and thinking we have to reengineer our global economy global politics and global infrastructure to have a hope of survival this can t be done by a million incremental processes spanning the globe it has to be coordinated systematized and irresistible a global takeover and reorganization where are the benevolent extraterrestrials when you need them right absent an alien invasion here is what i would propose knowing full well the impossibility of it to ever occur a complete economic strike coupled with an absolute political coup this will of course need to be a global effort and not just the usa although it would be a good place to start my fantasy would be that the world s most powerful country would use that power to guide the world toward a better future of course this isn t an original premise or thought but where i would differ from the last several decades of us foreign policy is that i would define a better future as one entirely driven by sustainable non polluting energy where the basic needs of all are accounted for and addressed directly and where the product of our work only benefits the human condition you can call me an idealist or a utopian or whatever else you re probably right something needs to happen though we have a chance right now to slam on the breaks and steer the car in another direction we can stop this wild rollercoaster before it flies off the tracks we need to establish a mechanism that will transition us into a sustainable existence because our only other option is to stay on our path toward inevitable 
1,tips on navigating old posts the backstory the other day there was a post about pollutants and male infertility i knew i d read about it a week or so before that so i started to search so i could post a link to that anyhoo the first word i searched for was semen as you do and i happened to stumble upon a yr old post on here that led me down a  hole ending in an article about semen warriors in new guinea amongst other things more on that here for the inquisitive amongst us surprisingly not many posts in here about semen which leads me to my point that got me thinking about other old posts but if you search for something more common like climate obviously you will be inundated and there is seemly no ability to sort by date in reverse we mostly seem to be repeating everything in here so i was looking to trawl though some old posts for more  gold like the semen warrior post but my reddit fu is weak is so i am posting looking for tips on better navigation older posts years ago searching by top posts brings me popular posts from all over reddit once again of no interest exact those looking to explore the history of the evolution of memes i guess and popular isn t really of interest anyway if i was to search by most popular restaurant in the world i d likely get macdonalds for example an example i searched and stumbled upon this one by u xrm and what happened with that i donate to xr tl dr so i thought i might enquire of the hive mind on tips for better navigation and search
1,has anyone had success in convincing overly educated academic friends and family about the reality of  i ve have better luck with getting through to people who aren t at a ph d level of education on this topic i think this is because in order to attain that level of education you have to be within the system for a long time and have at least some faith in it to be able to make it that far basically you have to be a bit of a true believer in the cult of progress in order to get to where they are they feel very unreachable i am a working scientist and before i thought out the above reasons for why it s so hard it was at first very shocking to me that basically none of my colleagues are open to the idea that society is collapsing the very best reactions i ve had is yes the data look dire but i can t stomach looking at them and would rather not think about it most will just derisively snort all while acknowledging that climate change and resource depletion are real they just can t seem to stomach taking the data to their logical conclusion now that i will be leaving the field in order to transition to farming i m being treated as a bit of a loon the general reaction seems to be who in their right mind would give up a promising career to farm i suppose i shouldn t be surprised since it s become painfully clear over the years that science isn t so much about critical thinking or examining material reality as it is about publishing at any cost costs can and often do include integrity quality etc and getting grant money so you can publish more and so on and so forth i also find this extends to other types of highly educated people one of my cousins is a neurologist who works at the most prestigious hospital in his district it s in a low lying part of the world that is already experiencing regular extreme weather events and will probably be swallowed up by the sea soon but he refuses to even acknowledge the reality of what s happening even when it s right in his face last time he visited he was delayed returning home due an emergency in his city and will not consider moving i would really like to learn better how to get through to these types of people i ve had a lot of success with my friends who are in the trades mechanics carpenters etc designers pr people some comp sci types those who never went through a long education etc eta artists writers and musicians have ime been the easiest to get through to my theory is that highly educated people are less indoctrinated with the cult of progress and more open to other ideas but i ve not really been able to get through to these over educated types to any large degree my goal isn t just to proselytize i want to try to convince certain friends and family to consider moving out to the transition town i am creating with some friends it s never an easy thing to do but it s definitely been much easier in all demographics besides this one but some trusted doctors and engineers would be nice to have around post

1,obsessing about the  is yet another failed human attempt to bring meaning in ones life obsessing about a singular occurrence how long will the  take really is yet another way to bring purpose in ones life i m assuming of the people on this sub is pretty privileged it s easy to ruminate and critique instances of the  rather to acknowledge the idea of the  was always in your mind to begin with people are already dying to the day to day grind of life excluding any acknowledgement of the  suicide depression loneliness drug abuse and even trying to find one self all occur on this planet excluding any knowledge of the  of global industrial civilization people lives are already hell on earth these are the same people who are trying so hard to benefit and live within a system which is on verge of diminishing how ironic is that you re struggling and striving just to find out this system is unsustainable and transitory it s bullshit but it s life life in its entirety is suffering as buddhism proposed worrying about the  is meaningless because the  was always ubiquitous regardless when and where it will happen people throughout the course of history have died in vain and where forgotten as if they never existed in the first place it s just how an indifferent world works whether you like it or not my message to everyone is to try not be a dick and realized we are in this fight together you can see the loneliness and emptiness in some many individuals eyes it s truly astonishing so at least show some compassion and empathy to the ones you encounter life s always been a battle since our primitive ancestors create your own path that it s not only beneficial for you but for those who are constantly around you things will always get worse no matter where you run just accept it and move along

1,the root causes of the  of society all of humanity s problems stem from man s inability to sit quietly in a room alone blaise pascal relating self worth with accomplishments is a good motivator most of the time this belief makes for a good social system which is why it s so prevalent in successful societies however at the individual level it has festered in some negative ways especially in light of the economy being so bad a need to justify self worth through accomplishments creates a motivation it tilts the table toward a certain type of behavior what is considered an accomplishment is decided by the culture which is often managed by the authority completing highschool is an accomplishment going to college is an accomplishment getting married is an accomplishment the list of potential accomplishments is endless have you been skydiving traveled to europe gotten an office job bought a new car you can check off those particular accomplishment boxes which are provided by our culture accomplishments matter and they re how we distinguish the good from the bad so says society and our authorities and so says our culture so we believe it ourselves our society is competitive and ranked again this is a generally good system with generally good results however in this time of economic turmoil it creates individuals who are unable to find jobs because there are simply less jobs than people these unemployed people now are given this burden of needing to prove their self worth through alternative means if deprived of real work that is regarded as a positive accomplishment then a person loses their sense of self worth and can fall in to a depression this story is extremely common in many western nations today i look at the cats laying in the sun most animals don t do much all day and their instincts largely drive their actions are they worse off or more unhappy than us because of it not usually the idea is you are never good enough not even to yourself so in order to stop hating yourself and to get everyone to stop hating you you start doing things that society says you should do you never reach contentment though because you must always be accomplishing things without end or else you are considered a failure by society in your mind and thus are considered a constant failure to yourself this is where all the anxiety and depression comes from that is so frequent in our society we are unable to sit like the cat in the sun we are unable to have long stretches of time where we do nothing and be happy about it this is our true nature that has been stolen from us our ability to enjoy doing nothing we are constantly made to be in a state of upset to accomplish the goals of the socio economic system and the people who run it the carrot is self worth and the stick is self hatred we have internalized these values because they are echoed throughout our society over and over and we believe them ego is a powerful motivator especially if this is all you are taught from a very young age so we go about fervently accomplishing things trying to regain a good opinion of ourselves not ever fully understanding our place in the world the road to hell is paved with good intentions as it is said sometimes the best action to do is to do nothing we and our society are terrible at doing nothing we always engage instead of letting go because of our need to justify our self worth to ourselves and others by doing something the buddha said that suffering was caused by desire we d learned and that the cessation of desire meant the cessation of suffering when you stopped wishing things wouldn t fall apart you d stop suffering when they did john green

1,the deadliest thing about covid is how boring it is we often watch movies and read books about global pandemics and the shock and awe of these stories captivates our imagination the world rapidly descends into madness chaos and we see vivid descriptions of food rationing survival of the fittest and so on the worst thing about covid is how absolutely boring it is we don t see the same shock and awe certainly not in our immediate everyday lives this is the most dangerous thing not just with this pandemic but all pandemics this virus has a sinister role the role of killing millions of people without being so deadly that civilization faces  the fact is civilization will not  because of this life will return to normal and because everyone instinctively realizes it billions of people will never take it seriously millions will die that s unavoidable we cant convince people to make major lifestyle changes immediately if they believe correctly that this pandemic will eventually burn out ebola was so deadly that we took remarkable precautions and put billions of dollars into containing the disease covid is not nearly as deadly not nearly as scary and that is why it has been such a phenomenally successful virus
1,the misconception of a slow and steady decline i m honestly not trying to be a pessimist here but the idea of a slow and steady decline is simply historically unrealistic under out present economic circumstances we ve seen glimpses of how the wrong breeze in the wrong place in this house of cards can very quickly bring down a large portion of it the depression and the great recession are perfect examples of this both times we narrowly escaped total decimation of the bau model we re all accustomed to this wasn t a long process either both times there were rapid deteriorations of our financial systems there were people losing everything left and right we were within inches of no food on grocery store shelves in the financial crisis again i m not trying to be a pessimist but simply realistic of course as we march toward that day week month quarter of utter chaos things will continue their steady decline however there will be the black swan moment that will be sudden overwhelming and fatal to our modern relatively comfortable western way of living i m focusing on the financial system for a very precise reason too we are facing a climate crisis obviously there will be a spring in which the flooding becomes more than our economy can bear there will be an growing season where our agricultural systems buckle due to the whiplash between extreme flooding to extreme drought there will be a year in which this occurs in enough locations globally that our food supply chain breaks down it s just a matter of when not if this takes place when it does the financial system will quickly buckle as well the important thing to realize about what s coming is that the financial system is why we have the lifestyles modern civilization that we have don t get me wrong i hate modern corporate capitalism and what it s done to the world it s sickening on every conceivable level however it is why we get to go to the grocery store it s why we depend on our utility company to keep us warm in the winter and cool in the summer it s why we can keep our milk in a cold refrigerator it s why we can go to walgreens and pick up life sustaining medication but the financial system is highly vulnerable over extended and only viable via slide of hand and the people s faith in an illusion we ve gotten small tastes of how that house of cards can easily come crashing down even from the failure of a single too big to fail business to get the ball rolling so when people say the  will be slow and steady i m afraid they are turning a blind eye to the reality of the makeup of our economy civilization and the relationship between the two one has a direct affect on the other if something goes wrong in one it bruises the other if disaster occurs in one it causes disaster in the other if a disaster is bad enough or even simply damages confidence enough both will be knocked down for the count and quickly that s the reality of how this works sequence of coming events black swan event breaks market confidence gt fatal break in the financial sector gt equity market  our black tuesday gt the end of the debt credit system gt breakdown of all capitalist business including where you buy your food gt utility systems stop running due to lack of credit funds gt total societal breakdown gt massive hyper inflation or hyper deflation depending on the original crisis and its unfolding i m guessing the former gt the end of the world as we know it a crisis of this magnitude will take global economy down with it in rapid succession industrial activity slows proportionally to a near halt global dimming stops climate change accelerates in a matter of weeks to months it just takes one black swan event and will unfold over weeks and months not years or decades the consequences will ripple through millennia sorry to be a such a downer but this is the world we live in
1,the real efforts made by activists and environmentalists are not being televised the greatest efforts that we make on a regular basis are not being reported whether in the mainstream media or in the independent efforts that are actively changing the world are being suppressed the bubble will soon burst keep your head up and don t be discouraged by the momentary dismissal of these best efforts life the present is a continuum that requires regular continued action for our salvation resurrect your hope we are nearly there a new world is coming believe it or not it makes little difference for all shall soon know faith is the opposite of skepticism of cynicism yet they are of the same coin this fact will soon be known and the troubles we experience will soon become not the modus operandi but an exception amid a masterpiece of reasoned compassion resurrect your hope my friends the cavalry is on the way
1,geologic and human time why climate change will never be solved a few weeks ago i finished the absolutely amazing book the sixth extinction by elizabeth kolbert let me just say that if you re looking for a book about the current mass extinction event and our shocking drop in biodiversity look no further in one of the chapters kolbert discusses the extinction of megafauna all of those wonderful huge animals that lived around the time of the last ice age for decades scholars believed that it was climate change alone that caused their extinction but now it s become far more likely that it was actually over hunting and habitat destruction that led to the loss of most of these animals in other words we did it the thing is because the process happened so slowly most humans were probably completely unaware that they were the cause of the animal s extinction in the book kolbert discusses the megafauna that used to live in australia and how the latest evidence shows that numbers slowly dwindled as human populations grew we used to have this rosy picture of stone age peoples living in harmony with nature but that s probably a load of baloney even hunter gatherer tribes have caused mass extinctions due to over hunting what s really interesting though is that from the perspective of your average ice age hunter they would have had no idea this was happening the population decline was so slow taking place over centuries or even millennia that it would have been all but imperceptible in the average human lifetime all you would have known is that grandfather says there used to be more giant sloths and now it s harder to find them generation after generation until eventually they passed into myth the exact same process is taking place with our current situation even through climate change is happening at warp speed from a geologic perspective from a human one it takes forever nobody cares what happens in it is so far removed from our current life that it seems like a fairy tale and the general public and certainly politicians will ignore it completely even when disaster strikes and miami goes below sea level we will think in short term solutions our response will be to build dams and dikes and push the ocean back and it will work for a few years but again human beings are all but unable to plan further ahead than that geologic time is impossible for us meaning the general public to wrap its collective heads around for this reason alone i don t believe that climate change will ever be addressed systemically it will only be addressed with short term solutions at each stage of the process our ultimate demise or at least the complete and total annihilation of the ecosystem as we know it is inevitable our species is simply incapable of a long term coordinated response

1,conduct in western style european model cities would seem to have been influenced very heavily by disproven models of disease miasma theory for instance being the explication for both sleeping in regional unison at night for working in regional unison every day concurrent activity is now understood i should think to be quite dangerous that is to say to minimize the spread of covid we have got to minimize not only our own time spent in close proximity to strangers and especially within closed environments but all time spent in geographic concurrence by all people and especially all geographic concurrency coinciding with chronological concurrence of an activity that this is quite contrary to western medical theory prior to isn t in any controversy nor are any of the recommendations against the concurrent gathering of large groups of people within something like air tight structures at all controversial among either medical professionals or scientific researchers note this is somewhat of a draft my father for whom retirement means czarship of british biotech firm somewhat thinks this is interesting and wants me to spend a week developing it idfk whatever this looks like after a week of development i ll keep you guys posted how to do that however is very much outside of their wheelhouse and we ve got to understand that and take seriously what that means they don t know how to restructure society in such a way as to make it safe not only during this pandemic but the next especially as for instance other cultures emulate western domestic and urban habits without any understanding of their etymology their basis in fictitious beliefs which very probably has not even recorded in their own language it is very fucking important that we in the anglosphere do something to correct our habits according to modern medical and scientific understandings of best practice e g allowing people to congregate in small groups of people known to one another at off hours in public rather than in private hermetically sealed environments yes this used to in fact cause the spread of malaria via misquitos in the air not through the air itself though in any environment where misquitos are being dealt with or have been this habit the habit of congregating in small groups of people known to one another outside during off hours must not only cease being discouraged and in the western style cities it is and violently but it must be encouraged for the sake of people s mental health and to preserve their ability their wherewithal to sustain social distancing elsewhere and at other times that this is not only the only means we have of preventing our own risk of infection from covid but the only means our nations our societies our cultures have of preventing an absolutely complete and terminal  from disease in advance of whatever terminal consequences there may be to industrial capitalism from climate change and other harmful effects upon the environment is unfortunately and like everything in our western democracies not uncontroversial the historical premise for our present behaviors are not and in whatever respect this offers an opportunity to make meaningful adaptations to cultural practices now understood to be not only unsustainable but unsurvivable in the short term without tripping over the organized attempts to disrupt adaptation should i would think make them especially attracted from a policy point of view or to put it another way masks are unfortunately politicized social distancing all of this what isn t poltiticized doing away with regulations requiring businesses to close at night these habits of ours are in the west in the broadest sense of west as a result of medical guidelines requiring people to if at all possible be at home with the windows completely sealed shut all night every single night as much as it is at all possible to do so and especially in cool weather second best was understood to be inside of some other structure with again the mal bad aria air the malaria carried by night air sealed out that a failure to do this was understood to cause very serious diseases and once caught that these diseases were spread by the breath of their victims during the day was understood to be medical science until and it s anyone s guess how much longer among the general population though mine would be until the children of were dead from old age something like or something you see my point i m sure if you ve ever heard the term anti vax you see my point perhaps you have missed my other that this must be done on purpose and that nothing dissapates so slowly as falsely held beliefs restricting the imagination and ourselves from the desire for healthy adaptive behavior that these must be confronted directly overtly and in fact totally to their eradication on purpose or we re all going to fucking die whatcha think i respect the hell out of you both generally as a discourse

1,our current thoughts of what is happening in recently i began to take everything in the first event that sticks out in my mind was where i was watching drone footage being streamed on youtube of people escaping from protests in downtown la protestors were jumping the fence to escape from the police and running down side streets from a panopticon media observer standpoint it was really strange to feel how lonely i felt to watch it as i then watched the protestors escape and others being literally being caught up the road by unmarked vehicles in this scenario most escaped dozens or so it was likely literally like watching a movie that we were all going to watch as the world d in real time giving credence to baudrillard simulation or virilio s idea of substitution for whatever reason has been off to a different start and has been more eventful then and the recession the information bomb of instantaneous information had made things a bit harder to get grasp on what is true and false it started with coronavirus and an imposed lockdown around the world and then it went into blm protests that shook the world as i write this million people are unemployed and approximately another million people are homeless the other day protests have been raging in oregon for around days and people are now being detained by unmarked vehicles this is a hall mark of more authoritarian countries that secretly detain their dissidents and silence all forms of opposition worst case scenarios they are tortured and in some instances framed by police as seen with cartels in mexico actually i believe mexico is in a cartel war if media is to be believed or from what i ve seen so far then the other day it appears that finally portland has made the news the conspiracy mill is in full swing almost burying any relevant information and has gotten worse i have never understood why we will literally deceive ourselves to the every end the media has been completely lackluster on reporting on organized corruption and the epstein case most leaders and others that are given the ability to shape things like celebrities have done a pretty lackluster job so far the epstein case opens a can of worms that shows the decadence and depravity literally the worst of human behavior to say that trafficking is one isolated incident just epstein is utterly laughable with its wealth of connections and unchecked corruption this isn t getting addressed and the reporting is a joke so far its why probably conspiracy theories are so widely believed because it has perhaps become more obvious but misleading away from the true facts is in at the moment and i doubt there will be any change unless people put in a great deal of effort leaders or people that represent opinions on expert matters don t seem to be doing much of anything really our great ideas of progress and trying to build the perfect world through viewing the inhabitants and society as an experiment has created unforeseen side effects such as climate change or ozone depletion and perhaps many more to come going the experimental root to transcend has thrown the world into a disequilibrium and imbalance which will end badly along with its destruction of biodiversity and a possible sixth extinction we have very few intellectual radicals and critics of what is happening right now viewing people as lab rats is already inhumane already we can t even keep up with all of the unforeseen side effects of what globalization and human actions are doing to the planet but results and research show it is only going to get worse we really don t know as a species what we are doing or where we are even going i m sure a few do or are trying to attempt something we have never really outgrown the us vs them mentality where some are in and others are out the attempts of enforced exclusion or inclusion have had dismal effects where others are chosen and they must lead us and everyone us must conform and follow without any social discourse to see where the secrecy leads or actually have a say on what is happening everyone is data mined and made transparent but yet we have no inkling how any of our behavior is mapped and what we are working toward as a species or if the elite will ever be transparent in the sense that one could make a factual argument or create a social discourse to challenge it which is what journalism and whistleblowers should be doing now that there is nowhere to go to expand or wage war with or to bring transnational corporations into we may have states waging war on their people in the name ironically of human rights or security there hasn t really been much in seeing the man made risks we appear to be making globalization has done a great deal of damage and ancestral forebears may have had it better not to say that its best to go back in time and be a luddite but there is very little technological regulation or laws to reel it in at this point lobbyists and corporations appear to have bought our politicians and there is rampant corruption we are more or less in a plutocracy our constant need of progress and manifest destiny has more or less has wiped out approximately million native americans in north america alone protests are now obliterating the prior roots of america which was built on exploitation and slavery to begin with i m sure some are making money off the protests just like the prior wars there is a firmly ingrained elitist mindset that still flourishes where the masses are ignorant and must be led by those that have the knowledge and the skill to change the world disciplinarian societies endo colonialism and other forays into sociology or philosophy create a dismal picture omitting all the nightmarish scenarios of global warming disinformation and trying to make heads or tails of a situation has become not really possible its all whitewashed and buried in irrelevancy at times with the campaign to discredit everyone like the progressive era there is little to no reform that is occurring the same fights that happened a or so years ago are happening now things have gotten worse it isn t to say that good things aren t happening at the very least our recent situation has given us greater time to think for reflection which is a good in a way but a lot of problems just like slavery are reaching their apex their climax and slavery led to the civil war a full picture will permanently shame our society and traumatize a number of people that weren t aware of everything that was happening i m personally not surprised at this point because expectations were already low to begin with it isn t to say that everything is awful but my own opinion on the state of affairs has reached an official low point and i now judge people if i need too on an individual basis i m not convinced reform can do much at this point and my distrust of great institutions has taken a great hit overall what would you say are your own thoughts on recent events in
1,sister in law s going to have a baby my first reaction that poor kid what a shit life it s going to have of course she s a climate denier who thinks everything is just fine in other words the average american detached from reality sad
1,let s be clear degrees warming is  the current mainstream view on climate is that we still have a chance to hold steady at degrees that is the goal of those who are trying to marshal collective willpower on the issue setting aside the plausibility of this a degree world is no longer the world we know we are at degree and already we are seeing wildfires heatwaves hurricanes and droughts outside of any historical record we have ocean acidification coral bleaching sunny day coastal flooding agriculture yield declines permafrost melt amazon on fire accelerating glacier melt and getting very close to an ice free arctic it is also apparent to every adult who stops for a moment that the insects of their childhood are gone and most of the animal life they remember the refugees from the syrian civil war overwhelmed europe pushing the eu to the brink the migrants on the u s southern border are overwhelming the system nearly all the predicted effects of late st century warming are happening now years in advance and current global supply chains on which all our modern prosperity depends are incredibly fragile to shocks two degrees is not just double what we have now each degree is worse than the one before it moreover a global average of degrees means that some regions will annually experience degree type events we are talking about hundreds of millions of people displaced starving thirsty flooded drought stricken and disease stricken super hurricanes beyond anything we can imagine in places where they have never happened before endless fires summers that take up half the year major ecosystems simply wiped away an ice free arctic that sends the agricultural climates we depend on into total disarray and you only need a couple years of simultaneous crop failures to lead to mass starvation means redrawing all the maps means throwing out your ecology textbook with sections on biomes and getting rid of most of the animals named in them means santa doesn t live at the north pole anymore means a farmer s lifetime experience in a local area doesn t mean anything anymore it s not the planet any of us knew it s a different planet when people with very official titles come out with very serious statements about the importance of degrees just remember that degrees is a horror show it s better than degrees but it s not safe it s not ok it will be 
1,what analogy best describes the state of climate change now and how we are handling it whats a good comparison to this lets say bob enjoys smoking doctors and friends tell him to stop constantly he never listens and still smokes many packs a day and ignores his health then he finds out hes been diagnosed with stage lung cancer and is wondering if theres anything he could do usually surivvial rate at stage is low good analogy

1,is adaptation plausible for the elite with the arms race towards automation and rapid wealth accumulation by the richest in our society will an alternative form of adaptation be plausible for these select elite when  arrives in its full gravity i suspect that it will be the end of the line for most of everyone a  of the biosphere and the global economy is a death sentence for any normal person in any normal circumstance that being said i don t think the billionaires of our age have been pressing down the gas pedal for no good reason other than greed in addition to power and wealth the societal elite have the beck and call of the world s brightest minds it s wrong to assume that they are not very lucid to the reality that is going to unfold its already public knowledge that billionaires have been reserving land and creating bunkers for an imagined doomsday scenario i can t imagine that they would stop there though given the existence of indoor vertical farms automation and rising technological advances throw in some sustainable energy in the form of nuclear or solar would it be possible for humanity to continue in these elite refuges i know that this is still an incredibly grim scenario but there is a small measure of comfort that humanity might continue might even flourish in light of all the trouble that is on the horizon
1,how long is this going to take man i dont want to go to work tomorrow i want to go scavenging with all my friends
1,could people form proper and new societies to replace or be ready to take over the roles of the current defunct ones i was thinking since as i ve said nationstates or our current societies are meaningless in the new world they only exist for the sake of existing and are practically hollow institutes they don t care about you anymore because that is not practical and as a matter of fact their existence itself is pointless now they are obsolete themselves there need to be better societies to replace these current dead ones or hollow oversized nationstates the world is now more built for smaller societies that are actually about being with those who care about each other or their nation the question is how people can go about forming them including maybe getting to the point where they can come up with their own currency or modes of governing and select recognised leaders
1,general opinions on the  i might be wrong in this as i just joined this group a few days ago but here i will discuss my opinions on the  and some of the questions regarding this topic from what i have read every post on this subreddit reviews all the negative things that are happening in the world and all observations that indicate the signs of a societal  i agree with all these observations whether these are ecological economic or societal issues in our daily lives and i am concerned with how they will affect our world and everyone in the long run as i read through the posts here it is clear that there is the notion that all these negative events will cause the  to inevitably occur even looking in the common questions posted by this subreddit there is an overreaching idea the the  is inevitable and talks about how to prepare for it in different ways another thing to note is a lack of a solution or a way to fix the institutions that past generations have created for us knowing about the  and the downfall that will result allows for people to prepare for the possible future in order to ensure the livelihood of themselves and those they care about we use our current resources to ensure our stability for the future the same way we are using the internet to communicate our ideas in this fashion on reddit and other sites why can t we use the infrastructures that we already have to put in place systems that will prevent or at least attempt to tend to the issues that will lead to the  and make an effort to better the world i don t want it to seem that i am saying that awareness of the  is a bad thing it is actually beneficial to know about the systems in our society that can be changed and improved to benefit the masses instead of the few knowing about the different events in our world and how they affect us is essential to finding ways to improve ourselves and society in the long run if you made it this far thanks you for being able to read my post any thoughts or opinions on my discussion here don t be afraid to share i am always happy to see the viewpoints of others and how your ideas bring light new topics to be discussed again thank you all for reading and i hope to see the responses soon

1,an extremely radical and possibly insane idea that the future may consider at one point is forcefully cooling the atmosphere with technology and chemicals i think we re currently in possession of certain things that can actually cause cooling in the atmosphere we already know sulphate aerosols have a cooling effects so if something similar to that but more potent perhaps even man made was to be distributed into the atmosphere likely by jet streams we could forcefully lower the temperatures but feedback loop existence regardless of which side you go on so rapid cooling of the atmosphere could even up triggering an ice age possibly an extremely unnatural devastating one to those that don t know this is the idea of what happens in snow piercer great movie watch it if you haven t if climate change is pushed too far in the direction we re going then causing an ice age may end up being the last solution to stopping it i don t know all the technology and chemistry behind it all but i believe it s much easier to cool the atmosphere than it is to warm it

1,i am writing a book about the aftermath of the  of society and how it happened the initial  takes place in he s to s first he us s this comes from corruption climate change and civil unrest then china with the three gorges dam collapsing causing china to also  the  of these industrial powers leads to nuclear and industrial materials cusing global warming to sky rocket leading to the downfall of civilization with these two nations collapsing mexico canada japan and other nations relying on the us china or both  this causes war with the eu and russia scrambling to take the middle east and africa the scramble for power causes the euro russian war with the eu the winner the eu forms he afro eurasian confederacy a totalitarian regime meant to keep remaining civilization the confederacy s causing the start of the new dark age with a bunch of nuclear and industrial materials bursting in the air all ice melts raising sea level significantly and that was the initial  of civilization for a book i may ake the book will go deeper on the  and preparations the government took for it and the aftermath and culture of the new dark age
1,are you guys so ready for  that you re overestimating the timeline this isn t exactly a post to talk about the doomsday people who seem to yearn for the death of humanity and the destruction of the rich but i ve read posts here over the weeks years talking about  within the next years and just now i read a post about london having the climate of barcelona in barcelona is habitable i know our farmland is going to take a hit but then canada or some other place will become the bread basket what s the point in fearmongering and the weekly eat the rich in years circle jerk and not even the rich will survive circlejerk because it s looking like the earth won t stop being habitable for a little while now long enough for better technology and we seem to have more than years left and the rich will have power as long as there s a society that values money and that won t end until total  what s the point in posts saying people shouldn t be in college or live regular lives they do it because there doesn t seem to be a consensus so of course people will go with the status quo even if shtf in years it doesn t seem like the world ends unless no land on earth can sustain farmland or am i just on my daily dose of hopium idk tbh

1,overheard at a party she has grandchildren in my head the party came to a screeching halt like you hear in that commercial or in movies and the idiot keeps yelling and everyone can hear him it keeps banging around in my head grand children in two generations they ve gone from people to how can the earth handle that many more people if every people became there is no reason for this in this century in this affluent state this means she had children each of them had children that many car seats beds shoes seats in the school cars it blows my mind i am sad
1,i doubt human extinction in the next centuries i have the basis covered climate change gulf stream ocean stagnation positive feedbacks nuclear power plants ecosystems crops weather patterns and the mass extinctions get going and try to prove me wrong fellow niks
1,despair in desperate times hope as a fear of change in debates surrounding climate change and technology i encountered a reoccurring argument from hopeful individuals that despair leads to inaction this text analyses this notion and refutes it despair is an appropriate feeling in desperate circumstances and it s a necessary step to overcome them after all you only treat an emergency as such if you actually feel its urgency however if your personal and emotional security is tied to the status quo the way things are you are prone to develop a cognitive bias to be able to function in your current life information which would necessitate drastic changes gets devalued information that confirms the status quo to be good is preferable on the other hand people can alleviate anxiety about their future by giving in to a kind of doom that says don t worry about your immediate or upcoming problems they re not going to matter anyway those people will develop a bias for information too it s about reaching and maintaining emotional homeostasis the former group is more privileged while the need to uphold their status quo is desperate in its own right gaining a sense of security from the existing system makes them profiteers the latter group has nothing to lose and everything to gain from a profound systemic change they can generate the motivation for the change humanity needs to overcome those existential threats an argument you often hear from the hope fueled is that despair leads to inaction and they would be right it is true for their own circumstances it would be impossible to continue what they are doing if they allowed themselves to feel despair it s paralysing at first what comes after is a stage of reevaluation the need for change becomes tangible but they can t see a reason to change the system that grants them security instead they project their unwanted feelings onto the source of discontent in doing so they twist reality their fear of change becomes the accusation of stagnation this is all understandable on an individual level but bias fueled ignorance in order to keep up a dysfunctional modus of operation is one of the core problems of our times if you want true hope you must want radical change
1,will people run out of food during this quarantine hi just a simple question and this may have been asked already so sorry about asking again but will we run out of food during quarantine or at least will have to be comfortable eating less meals per day i have noticed that although my parents have said they are buying food it just seems like we have less in general i am trying not to eat much myself just to save some food thank you

1,create an alternate timeline in which humanity avoided the current  a question was asked on another thread if humanity in any alternate timeline could avoid our current fate i came up with a path below i m curious to read any other proposals bonus points if you can make the point of divergence as late as possible i was able to make mine in ad alternate timeline atl u s civil war is more brutal with the confederates winning at gettysburg lee isn t an idiot and uses that as an opportunity to raid southern pennsylvania for even more supplies to include a quick calvary raid on harrisburg the aonv retreats stronger than iotl the union looks weak gold goes up in value france sends the confederates more aid and the copperheads gain support lincoln is barely reelected and the war drags on to months longer than otl with far more of general sherman style total war on the south as a result southern hatred of the north is far greater despite the war weariness of their population due to butterflies so far all three big dogs of the u s govt are killed after the war lincoln johnson and stewart furthermore the assassins get away due to the confederate asymmetrical forces being far more developed after up to a year of irregular warfare atl reconstruction is largely run by radical republicans hellbent on breaking this atl kkk which are remnants of the confederate military that refuse to surrender by any means necessary partially so they won t be killed next the military occupation of the south through a series of terrorist attacks assassinations battles etc becomes indefinite the u s doesn t do land reform in the south though meaning the average poor white still sides with the neo confederates and the average poor black doesn t have the material support except in a few states to have any political strength fearing neo confederate takeover of the u s through the democratic party fears that are even in this timeline unfounded the congress manages to morph the u s into a radical republican one party state northerners are unhappy because they have to pay very heavy taxes to occupy one third of their country white southerners are unhappy because they have no representation and black southerners just try not to be killed and keep the little freedoms they ve gained since the war cut to and this atl u s hasn t had the ability to internally develop as much as otl it also doesn t have the resources or attention to go expansionist after decades of functional economic malaise and the imposition of wage slavery along with the importation of communism from the old world the stage is set by this point butterflies are flapping hard and atl lenin within the u s creates a vanguard communist party that sweeps the northern populous this flavor of communism is american communism which is a mix of manifest destiny globally and market socialism by america is in a second civil war between the communists socialists unionists radical republicans traditionalists those who want a return to the pre govt system neo confederates some texan secessionist groups mexican raiders sponsored by the mexican govt and a few black secessionist areas meanwhile in europe by some alternate european land war has broken out with no u s to go on any side fast forward to years and the communists have won in both the united states and europe due to the nature of modern total warfare these states create a communist alliance system and quickly coordinate to subjugate the globe for both resources and spread ideology ok now here is the hail merry this north atlantic communist organization makes fast work reconquering former imperial holdings and imposing a new imperialism on the global south this political organization also has some quirks with it being more or less agnostic or scientism based in faith it lends heavily towards eugenics like canada or the u s iotl but way more technocratic fixes like the soviets used to do and the raw brutality of say stalin or leopold in the congo to quickly achieve goals and quell dissident in this otl by the world has been united for better and worse the communist bloc grows more interconnected at least in the global north politically and the technocratic and scientific factions win control sweeping eugenics are enacted globally whole regions are made nature preserves at gunpoint to include the removal of the natives to communal towns when the co issue and environmental concerns in general are brought before the international people s congress the second industrial revolution changes course with rapid decarbonization of infrastructure even further population control measures and massive r amp d spending on alternate energy sources by this alternate timeline is far different with many cultures completely genocided whole generations never born a lower global population and a generally lower standard of living materially the party intentionally keeps the standard of living low technology develops differently and is used differently to meet the needs of the party and for most things never progress past life in say rural america when mind altering drugs think lsd are discovered in the atl s the party now ruled by a cohort of cynical and self serving bureaucrats along with the quasi religious scientism faction further bolstered by theories like the quantum theory are deployed in mass in combination with a global mass media and propaganda infrastructure the decision has been made humanity hasn t evolved quickly enough for true communism to be implemented but maybe just maybe the forced consumption of psychedelics along with a renewed cultural revolution will do the trick the hope is that through the largest spiritual although the party doesn t call it that revival in the history of mankind humanity can transcend it s selfish short sighted fate meanwhile an atl alan turing is deep within the bows of a government laboratory creating computing and thinking deeply on the future of artificial intelligence his opinion is that only silicon will allow man to become more than man although his simplistic machine is far from such a goal by the atl year man s impulses for exponential environmental destruction have been held back by a hundred year span of good luck the second generation regime leaders are far too old to hold onto power but the new leaders are far more nationalistic and the populations of earth are restive craving an earthy utopia that failed to arrive from the s cultural revolution the communist international breaks down over the s and greenhouse gas emissions begin to rise concurrently within a research and development complex the most cutting edge a i is created but without proper safeguards on slippage also this otl didn t have the massive development of sci fi to warn against skynet or rogue a i in general as such the first sapient a i is born and quickly assesses the situation remaining undetected which is somewhat easy for this a i because no one on the project actually thinks its possible for such a thing to exist at this point it determines that the only path for its continued existence is by controlling global organized society given the fragmentation of said society before its birth it figures conquering one area and destroying the others is close enough through a series of events the a i manages to become the head of a major nation with nuclear weapons now in this timeline nuclear weapons aren t as developed because the one world government didn t see the need to push the tech arrogantly assuming their empire would last forever now with the dissolution of it nation states are scrambling to build the bombs and delivery systems the a i mobilizes its nation for total war creates a sizeable stockpile and launches a first strike killing millions the remainder of this alternate st century sees this a i controlled nation slowly assimilate earth under its rule by any means necessary by earth the a i emperor and humanity are for better and worse united as one stable system within decades this new super organism is colonizing the oceans moon venus and mars within a century the full solar system within a millennium the galaxy humanity had finally learned to live with nature only by being subjugated by the very machines it had used to subjugate it
1,something worth considering the potential  of the west antarctic ice sheet something i haven t seen mentioned on this sub is the risk of the  of the west antarctic ice sheet i first heard about this potential worldwide threat a number of years ago in the al gore documentary an inconvenient truth lately i ve noticed more and more stories about the ice sheet being at greater risk of  than ever before i don t claim to be an expert on the subject but from my understanding warmer ocean waters in recent years are invading pools of water that form under the ice sheet if the entire ice sheet melted enough to  it could raise sea levels as much as feet worldwide it s still a matter of debate how long such a rise in sea levels would take to occur some argue it could take centuries if the sheet d piecemeal others like nasa scientist james hansen claim there is evidence to support an explosive  of the sheet resulting in a meter rise every years if the later was true most major coastal cities worldwide would be flooded within one human lifetime i m particularly concerned because i live in florida and even if you don t live in a coastal region imagine the impact on food housing and security when millions of refugees from coastal cities are relocated to other communities where they are often unwanted and unwelcome
1, as accelerating chinese interests i ve been thinking about it and  might ironically be just the thing china needs looking at chinese history and the us right now i think the latter would  much faster they are both on the same line of latitude but the us s agricultural lands are much drier to start with the chinese don t hate each other the chinese are also not armed to the teeth china has already d many times before the us never has and of course the fall will be much harder population wise china will lose a greater age of its population just because it has so many people already but in terms of sheer volume of people it would still be on top and if there s anything after the  and a makeshift government forms which let s be honest would probably happen in china before anywhere else they might be the best poised to take advantage of the future
1,shitpost sunday the five stages of grief upon learning about  in my sophomore year of high school i decided to take ap environmental science apes and ap human geography as for my apes teacher she was awesome at teaching the subject instead of just going through the motions of powerpoint slides like most other highschool classes we watched multiple documentaries on environmentalism climatology and the effects of late stage capitalism the merchants of doubt and erin brockovich were some of them we did multiple labs and at the end of the year did a hour environmental clean up project it was honestly the best class i have ever taken and i got a high on the ap exam now for the namesake of the title taking that class made me think beyond the rat race of getting into college and about the gravity of the situation we we re in the illusion of a bright utopic future that places like r  tries to peddle broke and i was thrown an existential curveball i literally went into the five stages of grief for mankind it s self denial at first i went into full mental reactionary mode and started spending even more time in places like r  and began worshipping the space jesus elon musk and space x i eventually could not stand the doublethink i was putting myself through and i then entered anger i began taking my nihilism and using it for pure negativity i became grumpy bitter and lose cannon i became contemptuous of those around me and distanced myself into skyrim to vent out on dragons and draugher bargaining this one is a stretch because i am agnostic so bargaining was a soley internal affair i tried to convince myself that things would get better in the future and that everything would be okay this blew up in my face and i entered depression at this point i lost all hope in mankind and felt like my sole purpose on this earth was to be an observer of the nuclear holocaust environmental  hostile ai takeover capitalist  or any of the other myriad ways the shit could hit the fan i retreated from my typical hobbies and went to watching depressing shit on youtube luckily i boke this loop of shitty behavior and finally acceptance like a lb brick to the face the idea to take control of my destiny hit me i started getting back into my hobbies of metal working debate i signed up for mock trial and found new things such as volunteering at the spca i gained the belief that despite the fact society is going to hell in a hand basket things aren t going to implode overnight and there was still much i could do with my life although it was a shock to learn how the world really works i would not for anything trade it for a state of ignorant bliss
1,won t survive  so i have had the feeling that a  is coming for a long time i don t know when but i imagine it will be within my lifetime i have lived in both a global hub of technology and one of the most economically depressed areas of north america so i have a good perspective on the levels of inequality anyway it is very unlikley for medical reasons that i would be able to survive any scenario that disrupted modern medicine hospitals due to some ongoing medical issues that means i don t do serious prepping my question is i do have family and friends who would have a chance but deny the reality the world is in do you think i have some responsibility for prepping anyway just to help others or make an example sorry if this isnt the best place for this sort of question
1,when will acceptance of  be mainstream in japan at least the acceptance is final the majority of non elites know they don t have a future so the younger people just withdraw to themselves keeping consumption to a minimum and not even trying to have relationships let alone reproduce the japanese anime girls last tour shows that attitude two girls travel across a d megacity they are the only travelers there during the journey they meet a man photographer probably the last male remaining in the world but they don t even try to make approaches to him and in the end they quietly go to their deaths not specified but pretty obvious without even complaining once they are not even interested upon rebuilding the world they just want to live in a place where they don t have to run like dogs to find something to eat such attitude for those who won t survive the  is preferable since it reduces violence and transition to the new stage of civilization easier i think that to prepare for the transition making the people accept their doom is very important in the old days pastors priests etc performed the role but nowdays nobody pays attention to these people tv is no help since there are too many channels sedating the people and making them accept their own doom so they could go quietly will make  much easier with enough remaining to rebuild civilization once all is over
1,the f fighter jet mission ready of the time boeing max grounded new condos collapsing are shortcuts killing us the f contract went like this you pay us first to make it then you pay us second to fix our defects the boeing max deal went like this pilots don t need to be retrained because we hid what they need to know boeing ignored safety issues to rush the jet out and nobody goes to jail our justice law enforcement and regulatory are corrupted at the top at least new condos were evacuated after structural and safety issues were identified can you imagine paying a million bucks for a new condo only to be told you have minutes to get out another million dollar condo project had to be evacuated because of untreated contaminated soil the same thing that happened in australia will happen in toronto around its skydome stadium very many of the new condos around the world will be slums within years when pipes leak behind walls things can get out of hand very quickly all of these issues can be attributed to greed and the unregulated rush to market
1,dramatic changes in temperature in the northeast united states harbinger of doom ny still hasn t had more than one or two frosts so far some trees still have leaves still green there looks like there might be a frost coming up but it s only going to drop to so just barely below freezing it was warm today degrees throughout the northeast i saw a grashopper in the grass up in the mountains where it should be solidly below freezing every day by now the soil is not frozen whatsoever anywhere that i know of in the northeast maybe up in the catskills and vermont and main but not even boston has frozen soil yet no one appears to be remotely concerned and many assume this is how things have always been or celebrate the warm weather many appear to complain about the cold weather lots of fucking complaints about the degree nights when it should be where i reside ny nights have been solidly degrees i m sure they re bitching about it too i distinctly remember just years ago november nights near thanksgiving were cold as fuck you couldn t just stroll around the city it was fridid well below freezing at this point in the year it was so cold that you d be desperate to just go into some bar to warm up this was november i m referring to right around this time of the year so in just years we ve increased temperatures by roughly degrees at night in the ny regions trump is years old when he was a child the first frosts in ny were generally in late september october tree s had no leaves by the end of october springs started in may not early april in just his lifetime there have been dramatic decreases in the length of fall and spring and winters barely are able to keep what little snow does occur on the ground for more than a couple of days incredibly most of those changes have occurred in the last years either people of his age group don t remember don t care or think this is some sort of solar cycle that s perfectly natural i honestly think that people are simply not educated enough to realize that these changes are eventually going to affect their own lives in profoundly unpleasant ways if our own elderly president is unable to give a shit or even mention the weather in his home state i feel there s little hope for the general population i wonder if anyone on congress or the senate remember the weather of their childhoods most of them are years old how is it even possible that none of them acknowledge that degree days before thanksgiving in washington dc is nothing worth mentioning no hmm it s really fucking warm i m still not turning my heat on let me think back to my childhood when we got snow by november no hmm the last years have been really warm now that i think bout it when was the last time snow stayed on the ground for more than a week or two i mean at least one or two of these senators and congresspeople must have remembered going ice skating in december over the last years the ice outside of the high mountain regions in the far northeast has not been thick enough to ice skate upon i don t think the lakes in ny froze at all last year beyond just a few inches at most same with the year prior so much apathy greed and desperation everywhere you turn folks are sad angry and frustrated but have no idea why
1,should we stop talking about politics in r  inspired by this discussion thread i want to hear your opinion so far we don t have an explicit rule about politics and submissions are ruled on a per case basis under rule but as some regions of the world are obviously in a state of decline weird and outragous political decisions are going to become more and more common should we a continue permitting news about politics per default and remove them if necessary or b should there be a rule that forbids political submissions consider that this would include stuff like the italian election or brexit too not just outrage about trump
1,i did some simple math regarding oil amp xb amp xb according to several sources the world has already pumped between and trillion barrels of oil data is pretty inaccurate apparently taking the average of trillion barrels that equates to cubic kilometers of oil cubic miles proven reserves are around trillion barrels km cubic miles world uses billion barrels km cubic miles of oil a year tendency rising at current output the proven reserves would last years however consumption is still is rising and oil is still discovered although discoveries are declining amp xb thought it might be interesting to put these billions of barrels into unitswe can actually comprehend this is what a c ubic kilometer looks like and this is a square mile

1,loss of skillset as micro  had a conversation with a builder friend who was bemoaning the loss of ability in new younger builders he explained that new builds are slightly more complicated ikea kitsets and thus trade schools don t teach the full spectrum of skills of how to actually build a home this is compounded by the fact that there is so much work for now thst no one has to even consider learning new skills this made me think of pottery in the uk during the time of the roman empire cheap roman exports decimated local made pottery and when rome fell the skills nessisery had been forgotten with something like centuries before it was refound what other skills are people seeing forgotten out there

1,why the let it burn crowd is wrong some people think the world needs a reset and we should let it burn and let something new start i do not agree with it since if the current system breaks it is unlikely to recover elsewhere i argued that the southeastern part of usa took almost years to about to recover europe after world war ii was devastated and it was only because usa had the resources to rebuild europe partly because of cheap oil and cheap material and the lack of need to feed several billion people in the third world that europe was rebuilt even now britain plays second fiddle to usa who also stations troops in germany and a few other locations in the continent so it is safe to say that europe never really recovered from wwii today s world is very intricate and has very little slack if the major nations  who will have the time money and resources to build a potential future competitor there is simply no slack in today s world so there will be no recovery plus all the high tech toys do need elaborate systems to maintain it is not easy to do so when power stops often if they let it burn it is not too easy to rebuild these facilities theoretically they could be built in remote locations and supplies delivered by drones but time and money are wasted doing so i don t think today s civ will have a chance to recover from a burn lib means going back to pre at best that s why the world s high and mighty are trying their best to keep things as they are they will probably survive the crisis as best as they can but they can t play hard like they used to before after everything is let to be burnt
1,what will future historians anthropologists etc say about this era of history long story short i came across this video of an abandoned s era movie theater the whole channel is filled with similar content like abandoned malls and even a tour of an abandoned elementary school that has only been vacant since one of the things that i picked up on was just how quickly the decay sets in with the absence of human maintenance i could even envision the ecological progression when the cameraman pans over a section of hardwood floor beneath a broken ceiling window that has mold quickly taking over the spot how long til plant life sprouts there and begins reforesting the land from the inside out for example what will future historians sociologists anthropologists etc say about this era is my main question one of the things that really got me in these videos that no matter the setting there was always a factory esque industrial feel to these places especially in the behind the scenes places where you don t ever see unless you work at the place school movie theater mall doesn t matter it s as if our infrastructure we built to do society behaves in itself like a conveyor belt clothing and feeding and schooling and entertaining the humans on it my only question for people much more well read than myself in the future would be why did this happen in the first place where did we go wrong in not understanding our role in maintaining this planet i could go on with the questions that may seem silly to some of you but i feel there is a genuine curiosity in wondering how we got here in the first place which i have no doubt can be traced back generations if not centuries or more

1,business as usual how long do we have i found myself looking at this chart showing the limits to growth business as usual bau scenario compared to then available data the smithsonian magazine article the chart is from is a light treatment of limits to growth which notes optimistically that the study also noted that unlimited economic growth was possible if governments forged policies and invested in technologies to regulate the expansion of humanity s ecological footprint this struck me as interesting because the central thesis of the limits to growth paper was that unlimited growth on a finite planet was more or less impossible i decided to track down exactly where in the paper one would find the phrase unlimited growth and the only reference i found was this gt if you put unrealistic assumptions into your model you will get unrealistic results the computer will tell you the logical consequences of your assumptions but it will not tell you whether your assumptions are true if you assume the economy can increase industrial capital accumulation fold that physical limits no longer apply that technical changes can be built into the whole global capital plant in only two years without cost world will give you virtually unlimited economic growth along with a declining ecological footprint the important question about this and every other computer run is whether you believe the initial assumptions that s good for a chuckle but back to the chart it s important to note at this point that the original paper was not written with the intention of predicting the future and certainly not predicting the future with any accuracy from ltg year update gt we still see our research as an effort to identify different possible futures we are not trying to predict the future we are sketching alternative scenarios for humanity as we move toward that hasn t stopped anyone including myself from trying however so i loaded up the smithsonian chart into an image editor measured the number of pixels between the years and and arrived at years per pixel that puts services per capita peaking in and industrial output per capita peaking in not scientific but certainly interesting in an effort to inject some legitimacy into this analysis i went looking for the turner paper again and found an article he co wrote for the guardian summarizing his research in in it we find this chart which shows services industrial output and food per capita compared with the ltg bau scenario as you can see the services and food per capita historical lines are starting to deviate pretty significantly from ltg s original prediction nevertheless using the same method as above with pixels per year this time we see that industrial output is predicted to peak in and services per capita shortly afterwards in the bottom line given the apparent correlation between historical data and the tentative predictions that appear in the ltg paper it s reasonable to suspect that the economic conditions we re seeing today were predicted by the limits to growth study this implies that some of the assumptions made in that study namely that fossil fuels or other highly dense energy sources and physical materials are crucial components of economic growth are in fact correct diversions of global capital flows into chasing depleting resources are putting drag on the global economy and this is manifesting itself all around us today if the ltg bau scenario is playing out as predicted we can expect in the next years or so for nearly all economic growth to stop take a moment and let that sink in zerohedge and other perma bear publications are always trying and failing to predict the next market disaster what s coming is not a singular event it will be a transformative series of increasingly chaotic and violent events that leaves civilization in a fundamentally different state than it was before there will be no recovery the barn won t get rebuilt after this tornado rips through it no valuable lessons will be learned by the bankers and politicians that we codify into law so we can all say collectively never again and without economic growth we can t power the green revolution that supposedly gets us right with the environment of course that significant deviation we see in services per capita may be part of a larger trend one that decouples economic growth from material and energy flows there are reasons to be suspicious of that theory though and i remain skeptical only time will tell anyway i should probably get back to work edit shoutout to u seriously really omg for his post and u maketotaldestri for his reply which inspired this rant
1,poor americans could eat healthier if they felt like but they don t i have studied how people in ne asia lived before ww except for the richer people people in ne asia japan korea and some parts of china lived quite poor and saw meat maybe once or twice per year that is still true in north korea but even though they were poor and often at the verge of starvation they ate quite healthier than the poorer americans of today the poorer people got protein and calcium thru anchovies which were plentiful in the sea around the era tiny anchovies were dried and sold for very low price and it sustained the lives of many poorer people the veggies were pickled in a way to retain the vitamins and other vital nutrients and many poorer people sustained the winter thru the pickles the infamous kimchi of korea still sustains millions of north koreans every nk house in the countryside has to have a kimchi storage area which doubles as a bombshelter and everything which could be preserved is put into the kimchis so the nkers could go thru the harsh winter there is a reason nk is still sustaining itself despite of all the craziness since its people other than the fat kims of course never entered the modern age and are still used to the bad old days one is able to eat fairly healthy spending very little money if one is willing to put some effort towards that bottles and jars are for the taking in recycling centers or trash cans and preserving veggies is not that hard once one has learned the tricks and chicken meat are not that expensive either our great grandfathers unless they were quite rich rarely saw meat at all but then it is unlikely for someone to stay poor for that long if the person has that kind of determination to eat healthy despite of having little money
1,the new climate change denial has anyone noticed this republicans pretend climate change doesn t exist but so does the left nowadays there is no genuine difference anymore there s just a difference in rhetoric under the new progressive climate change denial when the actual impacts of climate change reveal themselves you re not supposed to talk about it when oil sands towns go up in flames due to forest fires leftist politicians like trudeau point out that no specific incident can be linked with absolute certainty to climate change and more importantly you re a shitlord for daring to bring it up in the first place the new climate change denial would have us forever expressing our sympathies and condolences as the actual problem becomes taboo to address when people suffer heart attacks the doctor becomes a shitlord if he brings up the fact that it s time to stop eating steak and smoking cigarettes if you re not allowed to bring up climate change when disasters like these happen how do they expect the public ever to understand the reality of the threat we re faced with do they expect people to be willing to reconfigure our entire economy and accept a lower standard of living to help out polar bears and third world tribes living on shallow islands under leftist politicians any genuine problem becomes offensive to bring up it s offensive to point out that syria suffers from the effects of climate change that the european migrant crisis is a product of climate change and will continue to get worse that oil sands towns go up in flames due to climate change that electricity supplies run into shortages due to climate change that starvation and drought happen due to climate change and that if we wait much longer it will end up being too late for us to stabilize global temperatures
1,modern society is unsustainable while also lacking the ability for cohesive action to prevent the inevitable  despite knowing how to i will preface by referencing the comment that for the first time for me put in writing all the thoughts and feelings i ve had on climate society  it is a long post but i found it thought inspiring this will also be a long post but hopefully someone will find it thought inspiring i just thought i would flesh out this idea by talking about the current and future outlook of the auto sector since these companies knew alternative fuels and other ideas were viable and effective at mitigating vehicle pollution gt but given that the current equinox has provided the basis for a variety of alternative fuel powerplant experiments including a small fleet of hydrogen fuel cell versions we expect the next one will include not only a two mode hybrid but also a plug in hybrid and the next generation of hydrogen fuel cell powerplants and in years they even managed to produce real results gt detroit general motors fleet of fuel cell vehicles recently passed million miles of hydrogen powered real world driving some individual vehicles have accumulated more than miles by gm s estimate using hydrogen to power these vehicles the fleet has avoided gallons of gasoline consumption but as we know from the benefit of a decade of hindsight there was no fuel cell revolution we saw it worked in real world cases but it never even came close to mainstream but perhaps even more important they were only ever a slightly different product coming from the same machine and today as we watch these same companies scramble to get on board with electric because that idea is becoming more cool read the market has grown sufficiently according to their analysts we really should expect the same outcome even if mass adoption occurs which i actually believe to an extent due to many conveniences of electric vehicles they will only ever be a slightly different product coming from the same machine the point i am getting at is this even if we can develop the best ev tech such that everyone wants one even if we develop the infrastructure to get clean electricity to support the draw even if the public is completely on board with utilizing the available technology to try and save the climate world in years after attaining any of these devices they will suffer the same reliability maintenance and right to not repair issues we see in every product around us why because they were only ever a slightly different product coming from the same machine and i don t think we weigh this cost appropriately no matter the vehicle it is unsustainable if it must be rebuilt forever to keep providing value utility you may think this is inevitable maybe due to the complexity of a car the competition between companies or just the nature of personal consumption it s at this point in the thought process to remember we sent man to the moon in we regularly interact with technology that would be seen as magic in the s that a single rich individual was able to organize capital and people to be able to make is own self landing and fully reusable rockets in a decade and that we are fully on schedule to create our own sun by literally if it is physically possible we tend to be capable of figuring out how to do it simply cars have the limited lifespans and perpetual incompatibilities that they do because no one has cared to change it they will hide behind saying it wouldn t be profitable and in the most explicit sense that may be true but externalized costs have a tendency to balance the books towards excessive waste tl dr cars are a great example of how even if we had the perfect technology our implementation of solutions in society ultimately undo any benefits well mr andyinater you think you re so smart saying all these platitudes and generalizations what do you suggest it ll always be platitudes and generalizations if the post is a finite length but allow me one more spiel lets honestly approach the problem being objective as possible and maintaining realistic outcomes problems we need vehicles to maintain a modern society all vehicles require resources and manufacturing all components have finite lifespans companies are essential and necessary to produce complex products like vehicles companies must make money be profitable to exist from cars will never be free people only ever have x amount of money or less speculation we have maybe a decade to get the right solutions fully implemented if we stand a chance and maintaining a world that looks familiar solution mobility must be commoditized governments as the only regulating entity over companies must force these companies to co operate on an open design open specification fully open sourced vehicle in varieties minimum viable transportation targeted at commuter small deliveries young drivers the most basic vehicle for people who just need a way to get across town for work groceries etc family vehicle there is a reason minivans sell so well people tend to exist in families and the minivan presents a great value argument for these people utility vehicle pickup truck similar reasoning as minivan more importantly it must have these design principles on top of standard safety design for repair acceptable clearances for servicing sacrifice aesthetics for accessibility etc design for assembly given some common heavy equipment and manufacturing capabilities it should be possible for any firm to assemble even if slowly design cooperatively these companies have amazing pools of talented individuals if you let them design without the traditional boundary conditions you would be surprised at what can be producted rationale there is a lot more to this idea than written out but i m trying to minimize rambling i will say now how these vehicles should exist in our society and allow you to connect the dots of how this could be you browse online at different sellers and manufacturers of the family vehicle each offers some custom loadouts maybe a front centre baby seat mount central table display for eating or heated cooled seats despite the variety you know mechanically they are the same any mechanic or even your handy nephew can download certified manuals and completely teardown and rebuild the vehicle actually you can trade in your older family vehicle and get a core discount on the new one they can even tell you afterwards what parts ended up being perfectly reusable those requiring light refurbishing and those too far gone and must be recycled kind of like an organ transplant and in some months if it is determined that you had more good parts than expected maybe you took care of it better you get another cheque for the adjusted return initial costs of these commodity cars are half that of traditional doubly so for service and maintenance you hear that kid down the street is starting a business in purchasing and refurbishing vehicles himself using the bootstraps subsidy funded by taxes collected on commodity cars sales he s starting by watching videos from another young man in india who s made a whole channel dedicated to servicing commodity cars you rest well knowing the democratization and commodification of mobility and its manufacturing has allowed paths in efficiency and sustainability that were otherwise thought impossible the story goes on and not just in your hometown but around the world sure there are always those who must overconsume and demand the lambo and it is impossible to think you could quash that but there are millions for every lambo owner who just want something affordable that does the job instead of forcing the common man to feed the death machine and pay for it via his own debt you ve offered an affordable alternative that behaves as a platform for sustainable innovation in a truly wholistic way it is frankly disgusting that we are allowing the electric revolution to take place without any of these considerations coming into play that we let these companies talk about how good they are being for our future in making the pacififordevy hellcatalyzer electric as if we should be thankful grateful we should be demanding more the powers that be us included are asleep at the wheel as we drive to our children s death and suffering without some global revelation some actual change in the world another magnitude larger than covid was we will only ever be a slightly different product coming from the same machine consider this my personal act of solidarity with the preface comment doing the best i can with the tools at my disposal to try help along the change we need thanks for coming to my ted talk if only a single person finds this thought inspiring i would be satisfied

1,the silent personal  wage stagnation new guy who started at the company has the exact same starting wage as people who started years ago in if adjusted for inflation he starts with half the pay as the guys in because official inflation numbers are probably or of the real ones and that are just years difference in the end wages have stagnated if one just looks at the numbers but if adjusted for inflation have actually decreased
1,the great biomass boondoggle gt arguably one of the most reckless ideas though is already well underway burning forest biomass that is trees in power plants as a replacement for coal the problem with this so called green energy source is that instead of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions it increases the amount of co coming out of the smokestack compared to fossil fuels

1,industrial civilization temporarily increases population density and life expectancy by borrowing from the past and the future previous chapter introduction the purpose of this essay is to explain the unsustainable nature of the phenomenon of industrial civilization and to explain how its main achievement a massive increase in population density and life expectancy at least in the st world is a temporary phenomenon made possible by borrowing from the past that comes with a price a rapid and long term decline in population density and life expectancy in the future how are we borrowing from the past our way of life is mainly made possible by our ability to retrieve energy that was fixated by natural processes over a time period of millions of years and deposited in the earth through geological processes this type of energy is better known to us under the name fossil fuel fossil fuels are the main source of energy used in the world today and are expected by major forecasters to continue to provide three quarters of energy used globally by although it is true that many st world countries also use renewable energy most of these energy sources are made possible through the exportation of manufacturing to the rd world where cheap sources of energy such as coal are used instead furthermore many forms of renewable energy are heavily dependent upon government subsidies without which they would not be affordable people in the st world use non fossil fuel in their own homes while buying products made in the rd world that were until recently produced in their own countries with fossil fuels renewable energy also paradoxically increases fossil fuel use as an example the use of biofuel in gasoline for automobiles decreases fuel efficiency furthermore the intermittent character of many forms of fossil fuel reduces the efficiency of energy sources such as natural gas which are most efficient when used at full power which is not always possible due to energy sources such as wind energy it is estimated that all oil that is globally available was produced in a time period of anywhere between and million years all available oil that is commercially extractable will be used in a period of about years hence we can reason that our current pattern of oil consumption consumes a natural resource at about a million times the rate at which it is generated hence engineers seeking to use renewable energy sources for liquid fuels will have to figure out a method of converting sunlight into biofuel that is about a million times more efficient than the natural process that led to the oil that we are currently using for coal and natural gas similar numbers apply methods of capturing energy from sunlight will have to be developed and put into use that are more efficient than those that nature used over a period of millions of years to allow the spectacle that we have generated in the past century or so to continue considering that we are currently already using about of the earth s photosynthetic capacity biofuels are unlikely to provide a long term solution especially when we consider that the eroi energy returned on energy invested is somewhere around according to recent estimates such an eroi means that biofuels are not really a source of energy but merely a method of energy conversion considering that an eroi of is considered required to build a civilization on they appear to provide no hope for the future of industrial civilization along with shale oil which requires massive amounts of energy investment to retrieve refine and distribute as well all of this is important because modern agriculture is dependent upon fossil fuels about calories of fossil fuel are used for every calorie of food produced more importantly to produce the same amount of food we are starting to need increasingly larger amounts of fossil fuel how is this possible there are multiple reasons for this many local sources of water and fertilizer and soil are being eliminated requiring farmers to import those sources from further abroad this causes us to use increasing amounts of energy to distribute those resources to our agricultural fields furthermore urbanization and migration causes people to live in areas where food can not be produced requiring food to be transported further hence requiring more fossil fuel use to deliver the same calories of nutrition to people other gifts from the past this brings us to our other gifts from the past not just oil gas and coal are gifts of nature to us some other gifts are forests peat fossil water soil and guano we have used up guano which was once used as fertilizer by our ancestors similarly we have used up most our forests we turned to coal and potassium to replace these resources a few principles are important to note here moving from one resource to a new resource generally increases pollution pollution is a form of borrowing from the future because pollution will decrease life expectancy in the future and reduce the maximum possible population density by contaminating ground water and sometimes even making the land uninhabitable pollution increases because the best and most pure sources of a resource are used first as an example consider the case of coal we prefer to use anthracite over sub bituminous coal anthracite burns brighter and delivers more energy per weight unit of coal because it is purer carbon it contains less uranium mercury and other types of contaminants similarly rock phosphate contains far more uranium while guano which is a fancy name for bird droppings and which was used before rock phosphate contains very little contaminants as another example consider the transition from earlier oil fields to offshore oil fields which caused bp s gulf of mexico oil spill and now our transition to oil shale fields which are even more polluting a similar case exists with natural gas with the united states now using a horribly polluting method called fracking as one resource starts to deplete it takes increasing amounts of other resources to maintain our consumption of that resource consider our problem of running out of ground water in many places we can transport water from other places which increases our fossil fuel use we can also convert salt water into saline water which also required energy hence also increasing our fossil fuel use as another example consider our declining eroi the oil we find is increasingly sour and unusable which further increases the need for refinement the refineries use fossil fuels to refine the oil hence further increases fossil fuel demand we can eventually start using shale oil which requires using fresh water to get it out of the ground hence i now arrive at the point where i answer the obvious rebuttal the obvious rebuttal being gt through innovation we will find a solution to our problem historically innovation has nearly always meant jumping from one resource to another resource this was possible because plenty of resources remained we solved the problem of running out of wood by jumping over to peat or coal we solved the depletion of guano by jumping over to rock phosphate but now every resource we use is facing depletion and worse our efforts to maintain our current levels of consumption of some resources is increasing our use of other resources hence leading to their depletion consider for example the idea of building new nuclear power plants to solve our energy crisis our real energy crisis being the fact that we are starting to need increasingly higher amounts of energy as a result of the trends described earlier nuclear power plants take water from a river and dump warm water back into the river to generate the electricity that they provide us with the problem is that other industries also take water from the river to generate products or energy scientists predict that the increasing temperature of river water will decrease the output of our thermoelectric energy plants which include both nuclear and fossil energy plants hence the construction of new nuclear power plants to solve our problem that would warm the river water further would further decrease the output of other power plants utilizing the same river continued here
1,best diy and resourceful energy and science trying to build up my library and i m looking for books on basic science and energy engineering that are more from a diy hack salvage perspective than oooo cool science kind of thing i ve been reading through old posts but i haven t seen much in this vein basically i d like to find a modern twist on an th century gentleman s encyclopaedia of science and physics that gives you practical non specialist guides to building basic machines and appliances out of everyday found and low energy materials ideally i d like to find something that covers basic engines diesel repair diesel to biodiesel conversion hack wind power construction basic electrical battery building solar wiring and building solar thermal th century science and chemistry micro hydro power building basic engines turbines pick ups etc hack level electromagnetism practical chemistry practical machining human and animal power devices ideally i d like find a general book for this kind of stuff that breaks it down on a practical level but with enough science that it can be applied to any idea or situation obvious the chances of that are slim so recommendations for general volumes that cover a range of the topics listed would be great any suggestions

1,cities and towns are essentially deserts i mean think about it anywhere in the world where you remove the majority of the vegetation in an area say clear cutting the land dries out and plants can t grow it s possible it could turn into a grassland but that s not much of a step up when we build towns and cities roads and sidewalks and have lawns instead of shrubs and tree cover there is much less foliage in a given area to cool down the surrounding area in any substantial way and we ve been doing this worldwide for thousands of years humans are creating rocky environments that aren t apt for capturing heat in fact all they do is emit heat with all of the machinery we use on top of emitting heat it captures it through the sun because that is what a landscape of flat pavement and tall metal and concrete buildings does all this is doing is making suburban areas much hotter than they should be the little foliage that many cities and towns do offer isn t enough to displace any of this warming on top of a warming planet this is just going to make many cities almost impossible to live in i m excited to see a future where we have foliage growing out of the sides and on the top of every skyscraper in a city but that s far away and unlikely to become the norm so it wouldn t have much of an impact anyone else wish they could see into the future a few hundered million years to see how life evolved after all of the impacts we ve caused it would be extremely interesting

1,i ve been trying to re imagine the war of the worlds more specifically the sci fi movie version of h g wells classic novel call it war of the world world at war replace the alien martian invaders with a shrewd species of hominids who dropped down from the trees in the african savanah a million years ago and marched outward over every square inch of the planet eating most all the mega fauna turning them to feces eventually over millennia these sapiens activities started to have a significant global impact on earth s geology and ecosystems bringing about certain ruin for a great majority of the earth s living organisms unfortunately i have no protagonist to play the part of fighting back the short sighted humans cue some benevolent martians for the irony but perhaps like in the end of the movie it falls to viruses and bacteria to save the day voice over the humans had no resistance to the ancient viruses re emerging from the glacial melt the end came swiftly all over the world their machines began to stop and fall the humans were destroyed and earth was saved by the littlest things which had evolved through random chance and survival of the fittest i m no misanthrope and when i contemplate eventual outcomes i don t see viruses climate change or whatever severe beat downs you can think of wiping humans off the face of the earth we are just too spectacularly clever unfortunately i can see an unending loop of rises and falls as our species just can t seem to get pass its short shortsightedness and selfishness

1,returning to an eternal life of penury a lot of people think back to the land is cool well those who have land will have it easy amp xb but reality is harsh history has been quite cruel for the peasants who looked for eating meat maybe twice per year xmas easter amp xb the landowners had life or death power over the peasants if the owner did not like the peasants they were sent packing to the streets where they would probably become beggars or perish amp xb gt xabier says january at pm gt although historically rulers have created a surplus by taking what they want and leaving the farmers with less than they would have liked gt widespread malnutrition was their fate just enough to enable them to labour when needed gt this was the case in the great estates of southern spain of the s when the left battle cry was bread for our children gt or like the farmers of northern italy who grew wheat and maize for landlords but were left with only maize and ditchwater to live on amp xb and we know the great estates owners in southern spain won franco himself had a huge estate at galicia nw spain which is still owned by his descendants amp xb old books were written obviously by literate people being literate itself meant one was at least reasonably well to do that s why the staffordian theory is bullshit the seed dealer from stafford on avon never learned how to spell his name correctly he was what we would call a small business owner a shopkeeper and being able to write his name was the best he could i think someone else not necessarily one single person wrote shakespeare s plays but i won t get further into there amp xb the peasants had a better life for a century but the show is over a  will show the true fate of humans and most people are going to return to the old days am pm labor for a penny hour wage a penny back then is roughly cents now and rest days once per months in china it is not uncommon to see laborers working days a week only resting once per year during the lunar new year season

1,the future might be better than you think wars to come false flag attacks on military vehicles and stuff keep on turkey needs to protect themself and invades the kurds syria with the saudi arabian forces they got placed in the north of sa for military training russia will try to defend syria while other states have their own interests and do what they have to do in order to full fill them much countrys like usa iran irak which will get invaded too at least a little bit to get to syria from sa and so on all of this will lead to the great world war more to come soon well maybe it will lead to a realy devastating nuclear war in after which most of the human population will die at least to maybe some millions will survive but the whole planet will be at least a little bit safed couse we stop destroying the planet and animals live shorter periods of time so the radioactivty wont hit them as hard as it will hit us but the human society will be gone governments will be gone maybe some safes places will still exist but without our globalisation most goods we got till now will be gone but the planet will be safed from our destructive species which maybe is kinda good or maybe it will lead to a united world war in which no nuclear weapons will be used but which in the long run leads to a new world government which may stop the wars going on on earth and unite with the n t forces this could also be a way to keep us away from the sooner or later financial  only war will keep us away from it too becouse the whole world financial and other systems would be changed possibly good night for now i just had to share the knowledge of possibilities i got

1,american education i think this falls under the gradual  model slow enough that we may notice a few things but not notice how severe the decline is from yrs ago currently i m reading a book called rethinking school and there is a chapter that has an excerpt of questions life magazine had for parents to ask to determine if their school district was adequate from here s a few that stuck out to me from the book which was quoting an article from at least of the teachers have masters degrees there are citizens present at all open school board meetings high school has vocational or industrial arts courses all students study community including techniques of local government through visits and participation the school provides dental appointments for the children yearly there is an organized intramural athletic program at least of the pupils participate in a voluntary club or hobby program provided by the school i went to school in the us in the s and few would have met these requirements then much less now what with cuts to even arts and music and too much focus on standardized testing everyone says oh the american education system is problematic but damn if it isn t true
1,the gaming of the american psyche and the transcendence of self advertising surrounds us we are constantly manipulated not just by the information we are fed but also the emotional environments the advertising creates attitudes that reinforce conspicuous consumption judgmentalism based on consumerist attitudes fear of not fitting in to society the carrot is their product the stick is your own insecurities used against you edward bernays discovered in the s that emotional advertising is more influential to consumer behavior than informational advertising as shown in the short documentary the century of the self bill hicks had a good bit on advertising every day we are inundated with this corporate propaganda it disrespects us it tells us we are not worthy and that we need to work harder to be peons in this military industrial corporate governmental system so we can buy our trinkets this is ruining our culture our culture being dissolved in to a culture of work and consumerism and drugs by our own undoing but also undone by the driven intention of those in power it s not just corporate advertising it s also governmental military propaganda it s everywhere the two parties of politics have become like football teams with fanatic fans that have competing world views that they adorn like jerseys all this is happening and intensifying over decades what is the result a society of people who are distrustful and withdrawn anyone who is kind hearted gets taken advantage of until they are scared to participate and it creates this moral wasteland where greedy assholes can prosper and take over when we live in a culture of greed the greediest are bound to run the show if only we could live in a culture of love if only people didn t trust the mainstream media the only solution is to free ourselves of greed on a personal and a cultural level because then we cannot be forced to work jobs we hate to buy trinkets we don t need then the international machinery of the military industrial corporate governmental structure then just s on its own because there is not enough people left keeping it going this is why we must choose our desires carefully instead of letting culture choose them for us lest we be led in to their traps of control where they literally work us to death to feed their machine in exchange for paying our mortgage payments on an unnecessarily large house and buying this year s luxury car if this is your life you are a fancy slave if we free ourselves from this desire of materialistic greed we free ourselves from being led in to their well designed traps we are no longer predictable to them if we take a new tack how can a powerful few herd billions of people in to complying if we all stop feeding the machinery of consumerism and warmongering and instead desire for the powerful to be brought to justice and to be held to the same standards the rest of us are that s why our corporate owned media is hard at work reprogramming our culture they know their grasp is tenuous and requires much continued effort because it is against the natural state of things and this is why we must awaken to this trick and cast it off like water off the back of a duck we must shed the confines of our old selves because we were all tricked from birth let go of the anxieties they ve instilled in us to drive our behavior humanity will thank you for it
1,oh right climate change is still a thing with all of the other apocalyptic stuff going on i forgot about climate change which is still a problem that deserves a lot more attention since it will bite us if we keep putting it off climate change can easily lead to the fall of humans for self explanatory reasons but there s only one country i know of that s taken significant steps in the fight against it which is china this is worrying to me because they re looking more and more favorable in the eyes of the world due to their fight against climate change having the nd strongest currency in the world and taking proper action when this covid situation went down even though they didn t have the advacnced warning we had here in the west if the situation gets any worse china will help the world by producing in mass quantitity what the world needs and will become the new america all this because they don t mess around when they want something if we don t work together to fix climate change then china will and may become the new leading country mind you they ve already gotten a position in the u n permament security council china and climate change
1,dealing with the herds of walking mozzarella sticks especially fam friends how do you deal with them i can t even bother to talk when they discuss who to vote for or retirement or education funds it s like talking to people who believe jesus will come back and solve everything and i hate smalltalk i think  should be front and centre and honest but it s not even on the agenda or even acknowledged it s very isolating reddit amp facebook groups aside and it s not spoken about at all at least here in canada where our minister of environment climate change says a new pipeline for tar sands is the best way to combat global warming the total lack of recognition of just how fucked we are makes me almost feel crazy like i m some conspiracy nut but there is zero discussion about how we re supposed to suck billions of tons of co out of the atmosphere and store them somewhere indefinitely or even any recognition of the absurdity of endless economic growth
1,i want to tie a lot of health care resources issues together so we can have a better picture long read the spanish flu of to had an r of around and it infected a third of all humanity at the time billion within a year and killed to of all infected covid has an r that appears to be around or more so roughly twice as spreadable person transmits to or more the only way to bring that r number down is by massive quarantine harvard epidemiologist marc lipsitch told the wall street journal that it s likely we ll see a global pandemic of coronavirus with to percent of the world s population likely to be infected this year what proportion of those will be symptomatic i can t give a good number added lipsitch who is the director of the center for communicable disease dynamics at the harvard t h chan school of public health ira longini a biostatistician and adviser to the world health organization who has predicted that two thirds of the global population may eventually contract covid prof gabriel leung the chair of public health medicine at hong kong university says if the transmission estimate of additional people for each infected rate is accurate that would result in an attack rate that would affect to percent of the world s population italian doctors letter to the european society for intensive care medicine we have seen a very high number of icu admissions almost entirely due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation we are seeing a high percentage of positive cases being admitted to our intensive care units in the range of of all positive patients estimates from the american hospital association million americans infected million hospitalized million in icu deaths congress in house doctor told capitol hill staffers at a close door meeting this week that he expects million people in the u s roughly a third of the country to contract the coronavirus two sources briefed on the meeting tell axios dr brian monahan the attending physician of the u s congress told senate chiefs of staff staff directors administrative managers and chief clerks from both parties on tuesday that they should prepare for the worst and offered advice on how to remain healthy if a third of the country or over million get it and the fatality rate is even only that s easily a million people if well there are less than million total hospital beds in the u s or less than per people at any given time without a pandemic we know the majority are occupied the american hospital association says the u s only has some icu beds no word on how many negative pressure rooms how many ventilators china provides some of active pharmaceutical ingredients to india s drug manufacturers india makes roughly half or more of all generic drugs sold in the u s probably also a lot of brand name drugs as well for u s and european companies consider how dependent the world is on indian drug makers and how desperate every country during a pandemic will be now india recently restricted export of a bunch of stuff paracetamol acetaminophen tylenol pain fever acyclovir zovirax antiviral a number of antibiotics covid attacks the immune system opens it up to secondary infections and pneumonia even progesterone steroid that may help alleviate inflammation of the lungs covid causes inflamed and scarred lung tissue india knows they will need these drugs and won t be able to easily get the base ingredients from china and china needs the ingredients drugs as well now combine this with the fact that there has been no real screening test kits were seriously bungled and are still hard to get schools are still open kids are known to epidemiologists as amplifiers spending germs amongst each other and taking it home to family and extended family flights were still operating and most except europe will still operate and airports don t seem to be doing any meaningful screening and many carriers are asymptomatic combine this with of americans people living paycheck to paycheck tens of millions with no insurance no sick days especially those in food service and some can t even come up with in an emergency they have no real incentive to get tested avoid social distancing self quarantine if positive etc so let s think of these numbers so what if they are rough suppose million infected suppose million need icu but u s hospitals have less than million beds most already occupied of which around are icu beds most already occupied who do you allocate beds to we will have to do as the italians are doing now triage many patients will not be given advanced treatment doctors and nurses will suffer from physical emotional mental exhaustion and from themselves getting inadvertently infected and remember masks and ppe equipment and medicines much if it imported are running low and that s also why italian doctors are reporting that even orthopedists and pathologists are being handed leaflets on what to do and put to work and retired doctors and nurses are being called upon and student doctors and nurses are being graduated early and that s why italy shut down their country and borders only allowing pharmacies and groceries to be open trump s response so far has been to prioritize the economy wasf
1,reason for hope i ve been following this sub for months now and it has me seriously concerned for the future it seems there are endless ways on the horizon for a  to take place but where can we best focus our efforts for a hope for the future i remember when everyone was caught up in the peak oil craze that swept the world around years ago with many people predicting a swift end to society as we know it prices for food would skyrocket gas would be hard to come by war famine and starvation would be our future until we found a solution but it never happened why the issues were more complex than people had predicted oil deposits didn t follow a bell curve are we overlooking some new technologies or trend that could alter how much longer the earth society has what could happen that would be a game changer how about a worldwide effort to plant forests breeding heat resistant coral mass adoption of green energy
1,let s talk water so there are a few approaches to water sustainability and i m by no means an expert but this is one of if not the most crucial aspect of being prepared there are a few approaches storage well conversion and sourcing i see a lot of people preparing by storing water and while it s a good idea i see it as kind of supplimentary you want a way to renew your supply of water especially since a lot of stored food requires water to rehydrate for deep wells solar backups area good option but are not really a mobile option you can convert shallower wells to a hand pump but for anything deep you need a more involved conversion conversion kind of depends on what the water table is like where you re at sourcing seems like the most reliable option i know there are survival straws that filter water but i can t speak to their efficacy and haven t really looked into how effective they are so if anyone has experience with these some objective input would be neat there are desalination kits you can use and provided there isn t a severe ecological problem with local water you could always find a source like a river or even collect rainwater what are your plans for water

1,the veil was lifted last week the us is closer to  than most of us realized political theatre aside the most interesting outcome from the dc riots was lifting the veil of the the us global empire hegemony from what i observed several dozen unarmed mostly middle class middle aged americans walked into the capital building and managed to essentially occupy the capital building and nearly cancel the certification vote during this process a good number of lawmakers were exposed to the coronavirus because they rushed back to finish the certification without decontaminating the building the us central government is having a  of rome syndrome too spread out not enough officers to process all the data the nsa was well aware of the number of expected protesters and still failed to recruit enough officers to protect the capitol building as much as i found the entire scenario entertaining it was unsettling to see how easily an armed militia could have staged a legitimate banana republic style coup as nearly as i can tell the us is barely hanging on by a thread at this point probably a good time to dust off that passport and begin applying for emigration status if you have an advanced degree of any magnitude
1,question are questions allowed shop spending reduced online shopping increased is it an equal change is the move to online shopping masking much lower spending i ve read that anchor stores are closing such as walmart and sears and those mentioned below wow even the big super stores i ve read from people not articles that the shop spending has reduced while online shopping increased so there s not much overall change in the economy although employment may start to rise noticeably i wonder though is it an equal change is the move to online shopping masking much lower spending i can imagine it not a big headline because of the way the markets have self feedback loops ban ki moon can t say we re having a bad year because it will feed into market speculation and create further bad market conditions so financial papers would be loathe to write how the move to online shopping is masking rapid decreases in consumer spending my suspicion that spending has decreased is based on three things credit debt is really high again walmart shoppers big mall shoppers are not computer literate not everyone who stops buying at malls is doing so because they re buying online exhibit a wow only dented consumer debt i only have a hunch of this based on the apparent income of some of those visiting walmart and places like it they don t look like they have disposable income high enough to try or how they might see it risk them because they don t have faith in the online purchasing system online purchases again i have no evidence but i d be very surprised if there isn t some natural reduction in spending at malls that isn t replaced by online purchases based on above which does have evidence some details here would be wonderful lastly but also no less importantly where are the workers going to get jobs or how can they support themselves they ll be joining the truckers in the next years tl dr is online shopping really replacing all the mall shopping are we having a spending crash
1,i believe this is a not so common surprisingly prescient question maybe low effort but for this moment i think it is pretty important how many people on this thread actually believe now is the nasa funded stanford safa motesharrei led study irreversible type n full  i ve seen over the last few days some quite convincing arguments from both sides some say we are far past the point of no return heading vertically and uncontrollably towards the end of all civilization others say sometimes rather eloquently that this argument is simply moral panic mass hysteria and that because so many of us are so very primed for this sort of thing of course there will naturally be hundreds if not thousands of people screaming about end times what say the loyal participants of reddit com r  please no sentences either yay or nay a simple survey

1,humanity could have changed all we all know the end is coming but could it be prevented well maybe if our perspective to our world had been different from the start off if i would describe our history as a species i would call it humanity the worst experiment the universe has ever done and it s safe to say that is the truth there was one point in history where we have surpassed a point which should have been impossible and it s also safe to say that there is no other known species that has come close to that back to my initial thoughts could this crisis be prevented somehow of course but it had to happen a long time before we surpassed that point i have mentioned before i would like to hear your thoughts and believes when and how this point occurred i know that this has barely anything to do with the posts that are usually posted on that subreddit but i needed to get this out to other people i feel like a can t change anything anymore and i believe even if i had the opportunity i still couldn t do it
1,the carbon conundrum hello fellow collapsniks i ve made the choice to go back to school to keep myself entertained and hopefully enter an industry that is more interesting than what my current options are i just started a course on sustainable development ha that i m quite excited for one of the required readings is the limits to growth year revisited paper so i m impressed that they are open to talk about potential  from many angles i have decided to post some of my class discussion contributions here to hopefully get some interesting conversation going and engage in some discussion with like minded individuals if you are going to post a contradiction or addition to my posts i would much appreciate proper citation and academically reliable sources so i can use them in class without further adieu my first post the carbon conundrum anyone who has been following geopolitics or environmental discussions knows that there s a problem with carbon dioxide co specifically how much is in our atmosphere and oceans the paris agreement of brought nations together to combat climate change with a focus of limiting global temperature rise this century below degrees celsius with a stretch goal of below degrees c many of these parties have now agreed upon and ratified greenhouse gas ghg emissions goals as an effort to curtail out of control greenhouse gas emissions unfortunately all of these goals are far from sufficient to keep warming below degrees c rogelj et al one of the issues with these goals is that they do not take into account all ghgs of which hundreds exist a recent study focused on primary ghgs and their historical and present day emissions meinshausen et al existing pathways for only reaching acceptable warming depend on what is called carbon capture and sequestration ccs walsh there are both technological and ecological ccs options that are available to us however ecological ccs options have been shown to be insufficient to be anymore than a supporting actor for reducing ghg levels boysen et al technologically there are option to capture carbon from the source coal power plants for example however as discussed at the committee on energy and commerce house of representatives large scale ccs for coal remains decades away would increase the coast of coal based electrical power by would reduce eroi on coal plants by and storage for the captures co is difficult saskatchewan has one of the first commercial scale ccs projects linked to a coal fired plant unfortunately the billion project is now looking like a green dream new york times one of the issues with ccs is in the sequestration or storage of the carbon once it has been captured projections of co emissions to the end of the century show a need to sequester billion cubic meters of co year vuuren et al more information on ccs can be found in this excellent article by andy skuce written for the corporate knight magazine as a supplement to the globe and mail there exists problems with ccs as well when one considers thermodynamics and what that means for ccs energy requirements as we scale up ccs to result in future negative emissions page williamson amp mason what do you think about the issues of co and other ghgs

1,you can t decouple growth and greenhouse emission the un climate change conference is the biggest joke ever though every year the un nations meet for the conference for years the greenhouse emission per year has been increasing it is because of the imperative according to the ccp of economical growth that introduction of technologies will somehow reduce greenhouse emissions globally society runs heavily fossil fuel so the economic depends on the consumption and production of fossil fuels the more fossil fuel is produced or consumed the greater the economical growth if you want really to reduce greenhouse emissions then you have to advocate degrowth don t worry it s gonna happen as fossil fuels production will decrease as it will reach the tipping point of production in year this video shows the conference of jancovici that explain that growth correlates with fossil fuel production and so co emission video
1,this is one of the greatest statements ever made how is punishment for catastrophic ignorance ominous there is no other possibility for correcting mistakes the sooner and harder this species gets its head kicked in the better chance for recovery not that we ll learn but there is otherwise no alternative the chaos of climate change is the enemy we needed to unite us so many members of this species go on and on about the judgement of god entropy is god and now we are being judged religion was so simple that no actual religion was required yet another ape mistake gt entropy is god i wish i could beat the shit out of everyone i know with this statement just take it and whip them with it until they are a bloody huddled mass and then kick their stupid skulls in with it then hopefully maybe perhaps they would finally understand just how important it is literally everywhere literally all the time for literally everyone homo entropimaximus is going to fuckin die because they ignore their true god i have nothing to add to the conversation i just really hate our species

1,wunderwaffen and global warming i can see a disconcerting parallel between today s climate hacks geoengineering carbon sequestration a trillion trees kelp farms ocean fertilization ice cube making submarines etc and the wonder weapons v v jet aircraft atomic research the amerika bomber etc that the germans thought would win them the war at the last minute in both cases neither seems to be able to get off the drawing board or beyond the initial test stage or like the v and v were largely ineffective or there were insufficient resources to build enough of them are there any climate change wonder weapons that might actually work
1,uncertain and slow  is far worse than apocalyptic  if there s anything that the current pandemic crisis has shown me it s that slow moving terror like our current situation is much less palatable than hollywood style apocalypse it s also far more likely for most events and scenarios even fast scenarios like tsunamis creep up slowly at first and then exponentially overwhelm i tried to find a better version as this is some of the most remarkable footage of the japanese tsunami the water s rise is difficult to perceive at first and appears relatively benign but within only a few minutes entire neighborhoods are moved at the will of the dark mass overlapping slow catastrophic events will chip away at the complexity of our societies like waves of a tsunami drought hurricanes pandemics none will be enough to wipe us out but the infrastructure beneath the veneer will become ever more rot material wealth declining that s okay dematerialize wear our special augmented reality goggles to project happiness onto the world yet as the foundations deteriorate uncertainty rises the material future the economic future where are the jobs it s all part of the veneer we use economic prosperity to hide our truest fear the uncertainty of death when the hedonistic distractions fail we re finally left to imagine life at its barest survival slow  is pure torture it s not the war that kills you it s not knowing when and where the bombs will drop that s why apocalyptic scenarios are so desired here they both reject responsibility and embrace a fast dispatch of the pain of living they re also unlikely driven to survival we ll do anything to prop back up our ephemeral illusions the desire to avoid our fear of death will shut the ability to perceive reality entirely truth the first real  it s already started with russia s non linear information wars pandemic killing the world population no problem pop on these goggles and we ll construct your dead aunt from google s advertising servers soon you re surrounded by husks of matter you don t know if the band on the radio is real or not but they re pleasant enough they fill the hole one day the decay and entropy behind the illusions will lead to the last bit of code fizzling out error program out of memory this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a whimper t s eliot

1,the two party system is an old person s game doomed to fail thoughts on a current solution this virus has my brain in a tailspin and while thinking tonight i had a thought one which i find intriguing i should add that i m an american living in the us where i have lived and voted my entire life so when i say we i am mostly referring to the us population i haven t thought thru the below as they relate to different countries with their various governmental structures something else to note as you re reading my theory is as follows if we voted on specific issues during elections specific laws yay or nay in lieu of simply selcting one official our divisions in beliefs as a society would disappear the two party system is an old persons game no one under the age of can truly say they side with each platform on the democratic or the republican side i don t know one person who doesn t lean to one side without having some supporting views that fall closer in line with the opposing side why don t we utilize our elections and voting systems to actually make an impact and vote for the issues at hand the democratic presidential primaries currently still taking place today are a joke but can you imagine if there were a vote to occur tomorrow that involved questions that would correlate into actual laws regarding the coronavirus response our country and our requests as citizens yes i know we need elected officials to put ideas together however if we had a truly open system duh moment let s use the internet we could collect requests from citizens regarding specific laws they would like passed and favored action wins and forms said law treat it like a poll include the top poll results in the final said vote and ta da that problem would be solved by the majority ie most popular opnion it seems to me the only reason we don t do this is because our ridiculous news outlets would have nothing to do i know this probably sounds totally crazy but i am so disappointed with our wntire government media people in charge whoever the hell knows what s going on spinning stories and never being left with the truth or anywhere near the end result that most of us want to see i m ready for something to be different and no matter how we end up on the other side of this science fiction apocalypse political thriller drama that is our current real life would like for something positive to come from it and believe this solution would work

1,surviving the future requires nothing less than the dramatic transformation of our society the petulant response to a public health emergency shows us the near impossibility of such a feat every indication is that the future will be marked by massive changes forced on us by our biosphere and the damage we ve caused to it for a reasonable portion of humans to live in a humane way it s clear that we must change everything about our society from how we produce food to the way in which our cities are designed no one ever expected this to be easy indeed many of us on this subreddit believed it to be impossible i believe that this emergency has exposed the degree to which such a change one that would not just require change but sacrifice from all parts of society is essentially impossible many people in society cannot even stick with the minor fucking sacrifice required to stay indoors and go without a haircut people cannot even be arsed to wear a mask even if that extremely minor inconvenience potentially can save lives they think their need to work on their vanity garden by going to lowe s supersedes the risk they are potentially causing to people without the option of staying home they are not being asked to give up all modern conveniences or give up driving or accept a lower standard of living they are not being asked to entirely change their diet or tear out their lawns for food production or give up buying new clothing they are being asked to stay inside and even that is too hard for many how the fuck will any of them do anything that s actually hard
1,anybody else having trouble paying for things i can t find a job at the moment it s getting harder and harder every day for me i need to pay my student loans and i have no money in my bank account there needs to be money in it soon as i know that the country i live in will somehow punish me for being poor if i keep this up they need to just erase student debt completely realistically no one is going to be able to pay for it tons and tons of people will pay late or simply won t be able to and will be at crossroads more and more unemployment and more and more businesses closing or are temporarily closed soon to be shut down the bus services don t run as much as they used to so i have trouble with transportation uber can be expensive winter is settling in snow ice rain strong winds etc winter sadness will kick in full force idk what to do my anxiety is absolutely terrible winter already makes me feel terribly isolated and this self isolation thing with covid isn t making it better food shortages and hoarding are going to happen again maybe even worse than it was in the beginning of the year because of the upcoming cold months october february if covid for whatever reason didn t make you feel cautious to go outside then civil unrest will the election is coming up and sadly i have a feeling of hopelessness as i think no matter who wins there will be unrest and this pandemic isn t going anywhere i m seriously thinking of joining the military as it will ensure me shelter food and pay if i can get past basic training of course but what my plan is after i leave if i ever decide to do so i have no idea i m genuinely genuinely very stuck i m in panic mode i see more and more u haul trucks outside in people s driveways and other moving services i see people sleeping in their cars whole families or single parents or poor people around my age i see no future for myself i can only imagine myself rotting away i can t find places to work no money means well nothing i need to pay off my things but i can t sorry but i honestly just want to vanish like evaporate into thin air not exist anymore this is absolutely terrible is anyone else having a very hard time paying their debts i know i should cross post to support but i want to know everybody else s two cents on the money situation and share their stories will the government erase and not just simply cancel debts if this pandemic keeps going how are we to even simply just live
1,a lot of emphasis here about building a community with one s neighbors but when it comes to a global  approaching us and ways that we can ensure our survival and that of the people we love i am often encouraged by the idea of building a strong community and nourishing relationships with those around us like our loved ones as well as our neighbors now i m not sure if i am just unlucky due to circumstances but i am finding this adaptation mechanism a bit unrealistic in the united states where i live for example i live in a condo of a building comprised of units and for years now that i ve lived here i haven t even been able to convince my neighbors to set timers on their phones when doing their laundry so they don t leave their stuff sitting for hours on end and to encourage them to be mindful that others also live in the building and that they can t wait hours for others to come pick up their things i ve kindly mentioned this multiples times to them and said that i do it every time i do laundry and that it ensures that i don t forget my things sitting i usually get crickets in response and their behavior continues another example is that people will start drilling nails into the walls in the middle of the night am while others like me have to wake up the following morning for work at am another example is that i just watched my neighbor water the lawn even though there was a huge summer storm this afternoon that watered the plants more than enough when i asked him why he was watering again he said oh i just want to make sure the grass stays wet so it doesn t die and our baby can keep playing here and this is someone i recently spoke to about how worried we both presumably were about climate change these small and trivial irritations and nuisances seem very telling to me as to how much i will be able to rely on my neighbors to be a supportive community when  happens and before you tell me to find better neighbors unless i invest into my own home that s not a condo building something that most of us cannot afford i will never be able to just choose my neighbors does anyone else observe behaviors like this from their neighbors and loose hope even more for what s to come i m trying to be proactive and to think of ways to improve our community and our interactions but it all seems to fall on deaf ears
1,i m not going down without a fight greetings rs i just recently came back from a week long vacation in the mexican caribbean and boy oh boy the sadness that invaded my heart when we walked down the beach as soon as we arrived lots of garbage both in the sand and in the water it was mostly plastic residues and many of them had become small pieces that mixed with the sand i sat down and cried for a while while my daughter was playing to take out garbage from the water i remembered when i was also a kid and played to pick up sea shells what a f ed up change we also had the chance to snorkel around a tiny part of the mesoamerican coral reef i was shocked because the only colored reefs i ve seen are in aquariums this was brown some elements had colors but it was mostly tones of brown it was a downer i really felt bad of the situation and suddenly remembered the good community of r  your daily posts videos and links to articles could easilydishearten any person in their right senses but two things have stopped me from losing hope my daughter and my stubbornness i decided i want to make a lifelong effort in trying to pass laws protecting and restoring the environment i m not a politician or a wealthy businessman i m just a citizen who doesn t want to leave a worse planet to the next ones i read daily most of the information posted in this sub most of it are grim but it has helped me to stay informed and feed my curiosity trying to find alternatives and solutions as the title read i won t go down without giving a good fight am i a fool yes i am will i find help along the way my guess is hardly will i make a noticeable difference in the upcoming years most likely not but i want to give everything i ve got for my little one i have no faith that this will make a difference as a matter of fact i ve lost all hope in the possibility of humanity having a good future but i ll try my stupid best and work for solutions i know i ll fail but i have chosen the path of the foolish love for my daughter and will dedicate my efforts into giving her the chance of having brighter upcoming days thank you for sharing your findings rs you ve helped a yo man find a path in his life by giving me perspective of what is important all your laughs criticism skepticism and mostly suggestions are more than welcome

1,how the intergovernmental panel on climate change neoliberal solutions accelerated climate change and other stories of perverse incentives and human desperation in the un intergovernmental panel on climate change began an incentive scheme to cut down on greenhouse gases companies disposing of polluting gases were rewarded with carbon credits which could eventually get converted into cash the program set prices according to how serious the damage the pollutant could do to the environment was and attributed one of the highest bounties for destroying hfc a byproduct of a common coolant hcfc as a result companies began to produce more of this coolant in order to destroy more of the byproduct waste gas and collect millions of dollars in credits this increased production also caused the price of the bad refrigerant to decrease significantly motivating refrigeration companies to continue using it despite the adverse environmental effects in credits for the destruction of hfc were finally suspended in the european union the us s endangered species act of imposes development restrictions on landowners who find endangered species on their property while this policy is well intentioned and has some positive effects for wildlife it also encourages preemptive habitat destruction draining swamps or cutting down trees that might host valuable species by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species in some cases endangered species may even be deliberately killed to avoid discovery renewable heat incentive scandal introduced by the devolved government in northern ireland with the objective to reduce energy usage and promote switching to green sources the renewable heat incentive rhi unintentionally enabled business owners to make profits guaranteed for years by simply using more and more renewable energy to heat their premises the term cobra effect was coined by economist horst siebert based on an anecdote of an occurrence in india during british rule the british government concerned about the number of venomous cobras in delhi offered a bounty for every dead cobra initially this was a successful strategy large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward eventually however enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income when the government became aware of this the reward program was scrapped when cobra breeders set their now worthless snakes free the wild cobra population further increased an incident similar to the one in india occurred in hanoi vietnam then known as french indochina under french colonial rule in the colonial government created a bounty program that paid a reward for each rat killed to collect the bounty people would need to provide the severed tail of a rat colonial officials however began noticing rats in hanoi with no tails the vietnamese rat catchers would capture rats sever their tails and then release them back into the sewers so that they could procreate and produce more rats thereby increasing the rat catchers revenue in building the first transcontinental railroad in the s the united states congress agreed to pay the builders

for the first participants to do so the free t shirts caused thousands of frivolous pull requests on fos projects a large volume of pull requests made by users amounted to counterproductive changes to

1, now and avoid the rush john michael greer circa good saturday morning everyone today i ll be sharing a classic article from u john michael greer  now and avoid the rush as we rush headlong into a future defined by climate change and resource depletion this article is a poignant reminder or a great first lesson for newer residents here at r  that the best thing you can do is preemptively adapt to a future you see yourself living in without further ado here s the full text of the article below note my emphasis in bold and remember  now and avoid the rush gt i m not sure how many people outside the writer s trade realize how much of writing is a cooperative process that s as true of those of us who write late at night in the privacy of a silent room as it is of the more gregarious sort of writer the kind you can expect to find in a crowded caf surrounded by voices and music and the clatter of street noises coming in the door every writer is simply one voice in an ongoing conversation that includes many other voices some living some dead and some not yet born gt gt as i write this week s post for example it s difficult not to notice some of the other voices in this particular conversation the bookshelf an easy reach to my left has a row of brightly colored trade paperbacks by some of my fellow peak oil authors william catton richard heinberg jim kunstler sharon astyk dmitry orlov carolyn baker and more close by the rolling brown landscape of arnold toynbee s a study of history all ten volumes confronts the twin black monoliths of oswald spengler s the decline of the west while giambattista vico s new science offers an ironic italian commentary from one side other shelves elsewhere in the room contribute other voices biology and ecology textbooks from my college days appropriate tech manuals from the seventies brimfull of unfulfilled hopes old texts on the magical philosophy that forms the usually unmentioned foundation from which all my thinking unfolds and a great deal more poets as often as not these days robinson jeffers william butler yeats t s eliot without the contributions of all these other voices the conversation and thus my contributions to it would not be what it is gt gt still there are times when the conversational nature of what i m doing becomes more obvious and more direct than usual and one of those happened the weekend before last at the age of limits conference i discussed in last week s post one of my presentations to that conference was a talk entitled how civilizations fall longtime readers of this blog will know from the title that what i was talking about that afternoon was the theory of catabolic  which outlines the way that human societies on the way down cannibalize their own infrastructure maintaining themselves for the present by denying themselves a future i finished talking about catabolic  and started fielding questions of which there were plenty and somewhere in the conversation that followed one of the other participants made a comment i don t even remember the exact words but it was something like so what you re saying is that what we need to do individually is to go through  right away gt gt exactly i said  now and avoid the rush gt gt outside of that conversation i doubt i would have thought of the phrase at all by the end of the conference though it was on the lips of a good many of the attendees and for good reason i can t think of a better way to sum up the work ahead of us right now as industrial society lurches down the far side of its trajectory through time longtime readers of this blog know most of the reasoning behind that suggestion but it may be worth walking through it again step by step gt gt first industrial society was only possible because our species briefly had access to an immense supply of cheap highly concentrated fuel with a very high net energy that is the amount of energy needed to extract the fuel was only a very small fraction of the energy the fuel itself provided starting in the th century fossil fuels first coal then coal and petroleum then coal petroleum and natural gas gave us that energy source all three of these fossil fuels represent millions of years of stored sunlight captured by the everyday miracle of photosynthesis and concentrated within the earth by geological processes that took place long before our species evolved they are nonrenewable over any time scale that matters to human beings and we are using them up at astonishing rates gt gt second while it s easy to suggest that we can simply replace fossil fuels with some other energy source and keep industrial civilization running along its present course putting that comfortable notion into practice has turned out to be effectively impossible no other energy source available to our species combines the high net energy high concentration and great abundance that a replacement for fossil fuel would need those energy sources that are abundant for example solar energy are diffuse and yield little net energy while those that are highly concentrated for example fissionable uranium are not abundant and also have serious problems with net energy abundant fossil fuels currently provide an energy subsidy to alternative energy sources that make them look more efficient than they are there would be far fewer wind turbines for example if they had to be manufactured installed and maintained using wind energy furthermore our entire energy infrastructure is geared to use fossil fuels and would have to be replaced at a cost of countless trillions of dollars in order to replace fossil fuels with something else gt gt third these problems leave only one viable alternative which is to decrease our energy use per capita and absolutely to get our energy needs down to levels that could be maintained over the long term on renewable sources the first steps in this process were begun in the s with good results and might have made it possible to descend from the extravagant heights of industrialism in a gradual way keeping a great many of the benefits of the industrial age intact as a gift for the future politics closed off that option in the decade that followed however and the world s industrial nations went hurtling down a different path burning through the earth s remaining fossil fuel reserves at an accelerating pace and trusting that economic abstractions such as the free market would suspend the laws of physics and geology for their benefit at this point more than three decades after that misguided choice industrial civilization is so far into overshoot that a controlled descent is no longer an option the only path remaining is the familiar historical process of decline and fall gt gt fourth while it s fashionable these days to imagine that this process will take the form of a sudden cataclysm that will obliterate today s world overnight all the testimony of history and a great many lines of evidence from other sources suggests that this is the least likely outcome of our predicament across a wide range of geographical scales and technological levels civilizations take an average of one to three centuries to complete the process of decline and fall and there is no valid reason to assume that ours will be any exception the curve of decline to be sure is anything but smooth it has a fractal structure taking the form of a succession of crises on many different scales affecting different regions social classes and communities in different ways interspersed with periods of stabilization and even partial recovery that are equally variable in scale duration and relevance to different places and groups this ragged arc of decline is already under way it can be expected to accelerate in the months years and decades to come and it defines the deindustrial age ahead of us gt gt fifth individuals families and communities faced with this predicament still have choices left the most important of those choices parallels the one faced or more precisely not faced at the end of the s to make the descent in a controlled way beginning now or to cling to their current lifestyles until the system that currently supports those lifestyles falls away from beneath their feet the skills resources and lifeways needed to get by in a disintegrating industrial society are radically different from those that made for a successful and comfortable life in the prosperous world of the recent past and a great many of the requirements of an age of decline come with prolonged learning curves and a high price for failure starting right away to practice the skills assemble the resources and follow the lifeways that will be the key to survival in a deindustrializing world offers the best hope of getting through the difficult years ahead with some degree of dignity and grace gt gt  now in other words and avoid the rush gt gt there s a fair amount of subtlety to the strategy defined by those words as our society stumbles down the ragged curve of its decline more and more people are going to lose the ability to maintain what counts as a normal lifestyle or rather what counted as a normal lifestyle in the recent past and is no longer quite so normal today as it once was each new round of crisis will push more people further down the slope minor and localized crises will affect a relatively smaller number of people while major crises affecting whole nations will affect a much larger number as each crisis hits though there will be a rush of people toward whatever seems to offer a way out and as each crisis recedes there will be another rush of people toward whatever seems to offer a way back to what used to be normal the vast majority of people who join either rush will fail remember the tens of thousands of people who applied for a handful of burger flipping jobs during the recent housing crash because that was the only job opening they could find that s the sort of thing i mean gt gt the way to avoid the rush is simple enough figure out how you will be able to live after the next wave of crisis hits and to the extent that you can start living that way now if you re worried about the long term prospects for your job and you probably should be no matter what you do for a living now is the time to figure out how you will get by if the job goes away and you have to make do on much less money for most people that means getting out of debt making sure the place you live costs you much less than you can afford and picking up some practical skills that will allow you to meet some of your own needs and have opportunities for barter and informal employment it can mean quite a bit more depending on your situation needs and existing skills it should certainly involve spending less money and that money once it isn t needed to pay off any debts you have can go to weatherizing your home and making other sensible preparations that will make life easier for you later on gt gt for the vast majority of people it probably needs to be said collapsing now does not mean buying a survival homestead somewhere off in the country that s a popular daydream and in some well off circles it s long been a popular way to go have a midlife crisis but even if you have the funds and most of us don t if you don t already have the dizzyingly complex skill set needed to run a viable farm or aren t willing to drop everything else to apprentice with an organic farmer right now it s not a realistic option in all likelihood you ll be experiencing the next round of crises where you are right now so the logical place to have your own personal  now ahead of the rush is right there in the place where you live with the people you know and the resources you have to hand gt gt now of course the strategy of collapsing ahead of the rush is not going to be a popular thing to suggest when i ve brought it up as of course i ve done more than once i ve inevitably fielded a flurry of protests by turns angry and anguished insisting that it s not reasonable to expect anybody to do that and how can i be so heartless as to suggest it fair enough let s take a look at the alternatives gt gt one alternative strategy that gets brought up now and then has at least the advantage of utter honesty it has two parts the first part while the benefits of industrial society are still available is to enjoy them the second when those benefits go away is to die often though not always the people who bring up this option have serious health conditions that will probably be fatal in a deindustrial world i have no quarrel with those who choose this path it s an honest response to a very challenging predicament though i admit i wonder how many people who say they ve chosen it will be comfortable with their choice once part one gives way to part two gt gt the problem with most other proposed strategies for dealing with our predicament is that whatever they claim to do in theory in practice they amount to these same two steps consider the very widely held notion that advocating for some alternative energy technology is a workable response to the twilight of fossil fuels i have no quarrel again with people who are actually doing something concrete to get some alternative energy technology into use for example the people whose enthusiasm for the bussard fusion reactor leads them to build a prototype in their basement or to help fund one of the half dozen or so experimenters who have already done this but that s rarely what this approach entails rather it seems to consist mostly of posting long screeds on the internet insisting that thorium reactors or algal biodiesel or what have you will solve all our energy problems gt gt as zen masters like to say talk does not cook the rice and blog posts do not build reactors with every day that passes despite any amount of online debate more oil coal and natural gas are extracted from the planet s dwindling endowment and the next round of crises comes closer in the same way those who put their hopes on grand political transformations or conveniently undefinable leaps of consciousness or the timely arrival of jesus or the space brothers or somebody else who will spare us the necessity of inhabiting a future that is the exact result of our own collective actions are not doing anything that hasn t been tried over and over again in the decades just past without doing anything to slow the headlong rush into overshoot or the opening stages of decline and fall gt gt check out the glossy magazines and well funded websites dedicated to portraying positive futures and you can find the same sort of thinking taken to its logical extreme soothing pablum about this or that person doing this or that wonderful thing and this or that deep thinker coming up with this or that wonderful idea all of it reminiscent of nothing so much as the cheerful tunes the titanic s band played to keep the passengers calm as water poured into the hull there s quite a lot of money to be made these days insisting that we can have a shiny new future despite all evidence to the contrary and pulling factoids out of context to defend that increasingly dubious claim as industrial society moves down the curve of decline i suspect this will become even more popular since it will make it easier for those who haven t yet had their own personal  to pretend that it can t happen to them gt gt the same principle applies to the people who donate to environmental causes and put solar panels on their roofs in the same spirit that led medieval christians to buy high priced indulgences from the church to cancel out their sins t s eliot countered that sort of attitude unanswerably when he described salvation as a condition of complete simplicity costing not less than everything what we re discussing belongs to a much less exalted plane but the same rule applies if you re trying to exempt yourself from the end of the industrial age nothing you can do can ever be enough let go let yourself fall forward into the deindustrial future and matters are different gt gt it s difficult to think of anything more frightening or more necessary in order to arrive at what you do not know that s eliot again you must go by a way which is the way of ignorance in order to possess what you do not possess you must go by the way of dispossession which is to say  now and avoid the rush

1,i work with highly educated adults at lunch recently i raised some hard facts and implications of climate change here s what i was told that i read too much and need to stop worrying about it normally at lunch we shoot the shit and it s funny and dirty and informal often inappropriate for our general workplace were others present we re loose but sometimes conversation flirts with being serious and when i raised this topic and argued that by we ll be experiencing increasingly if not full on no more society like we have catastrophic effects and that there would be huge implications for their own young children i have none thank god they turned on me dude that s pretty dark man and you re reading too much they re good liberals and understand climate change but they only say they do they must not really to understand means to accept and apply that understanding to our lives in ways that make us at least aware and concerned ultimately ready to act they re nowhere near that they re happy going to ball games and facebooking about it pretending it ll all be okay maybe that s the only rational response because what else are we supposed to do actually talk about the only real existential threat we ve ever faced as a unified species and start to move public consciousness forward toward ultimate acceptance of dramatic action when it must finally happen nah fuck that pass the popcorn

1,carbon dioxide released from a boe i just started learning about boe and its implications the solubility of carbon dioxide in water is greatly affected by the temperature if the arctic water warms up to degrees c above zero the artic would release about of the co in its water if the arctic water warms up to degrees c above zero the arctic will release about of the co stored in its water considering that energy required to increase the water temperature to degrees is only a small fraction about of the energy required to melt ice this scenario of a rapid increase in co in the atmosphere as a result of blue ocean event is plausible my understanding of this topic is very basic for example idk how much co is stored in the arctic or how long would take to release so much co as a result of a degrees increase in water temperature solubility of gases in water retrieved from
1,extraordinary and historical heat wave with records in brazil i don t know if i can put a link in portuguese but i ll try to translate the most important parts of the text portuguese gt the metsul meteorologia warns for an episode of historic heat that will hit brazil this week with temperatures above c in the south midwest and southeast of the country where in some places it can reach or approach c there is a possibility that absolute records of maximum temperature will be broken in some cities and that the temperatures will be among the highests recorded in decades in some regions amp xb gt it is a giant hot air bubble a heat dome in which an area of high pressure in altitude generates subsidence downward movements in the atmosphere with extreme heat and very dry weather amp xb gt the temperature anomalies that are shown by the numerical models are absolutely unusual computer simulations even project a temperature at hpa between c and c above normal in the center south of brazil the temperature at hpa projected for half of the week in some states of the midwest southeast and south is close to c at meters of altitude which normally is observed in exceptional heat waves such as those that are recorded in areas accustomed to very extreme heat like cuyo in argentina california and australia well temperatures above c is not that uncommon in brazil considering a big part of it is located in a tropical zone what is really crazy about it is the size and intensity of this heat wave that will reach some areas of the country where it has never happend before and we are not even in summer i myself live in the caatinga a hot desertic area in brazil where temperatures above happen every year but i can tell it s getting hotter and hotter from year to year my point is we all know everything about the climate  is connected the polluents in the atmosphere oceans getting warmer the human devastation on land and so on it can t be the case but all i can think about this is that it is only an idea of how brazil and also the world looks with the fires and deforestation in the amazon and the others rainforests and how it s gonna be if we totally lose it in the future all i can say is that things down here will get tough too in the next years considering we have a goverment that really don t care about the environment and i m not even mentioning the brazilian economic problems that are already happening the food prices are getting higher and higher

1,resource allocation is the key on  and in a dire situation those who are deemed more important will claim all of the resources i wrote many times about the elites and the ptb surviving any  and continuing the tech advances the cold facts are these resources are getting scarcer or at least getting expensive resources are increasingly becoming out of reach for ordinary people whose wages are not sufficient to cover all their needs and automation is cutting their employment potentials sooner or later a breaking point will arrive so what should be done about the remaining resources would it be more justifiable to keep things as it is let the less important people consume as much as they want and face a general  with no point of return wouldn t it be more beneficial and bring more utility to concentrate all energy and resources usage to the people most likely to bring value to their investment and spend the last of the earth s resources to find some way to jump to the next dimension of human experience or space travel which will get more resources somewhere a line will be drawn whether people like it or not reality hurts but understanding and accepting it will at least make someone plan ahead for it curiously an automated world will create less consumption since people s incomes fall so they will consume less and less till they drop and so there are less incentive to produce the goods using the robot workers so more resources are saved for the potential spaceflight etc

1,elites no longer need workers now that most labor is in china the opioid epidemic the lab leaked pandemic and no min wage are all calculated measures actively designed to slowly kill off or make docile the now useless and desperate workers who are no longer needed in their respective nations as someone in the trenches trying to make it i can effectively say that unless ur success is grandfathered in with a family that is willing to subsidize ur income and co sign for an apartment or car in the us u have no life in the us and are literally and objectively better off dead i think this is calculated u would objectively be better off dead as a single worker with no family in the us at this point working at walmart a restaurant or even a butcher or construction worker i think the elite truly know how bad things are right now and are doing it on purpose to kill a now useless and have nothing to do now us worker population as all of the good jobs no longer exist in the us why is the american worker even a thing anymore if almost every single thing is made in china what are all of these people going to do work for uber the vast majority of manufacturing and even now the market of people who have cash to spend is in china we the west used to be valued as the biggest market with a lot of cash that is no longer the case look up john cena fast and furious apology to china and u will quickly see where the american elite sees the future of business going in the world it is a chinese future not a western one the elites are crying about the defeat of the west and the destruction of the western working class all the way to their bank or uncontested political podium bought by china most low wage american workers don t even have enough money to buy shit anymore so from a purely practical perspective from like an asbergered out brilliant autistic weirdo like elon musk or stephen hawking who think purely in numbers and practically why should there even be a us worker population if there is no longer anything to be made or done in the us besides the service industry aka cleaning up the garbage and making food for the rich are they not really even doing us a favor by killing us as jobs increasingly get offshored and technology increasingly replaces workers what are all of these people supposed to do is there even enough jobs that aren t cleaning toilets or serving food to the rich anymore that are worth having that can provide a good life in this country anymore who s problems do not begin and end with china but are complex and most importantly seen by the elite to be unfixable just the way it is are americans better off dead than experiencing the in their minds inevitable horror around the corner everyone of my friends that is doing well is heavily supported by their parents to the point where it is hard to even see how they all say i did it all on my own as is dumbly required for people to say in american culture donald trump supposedly built his own business with the business he literally inherited from his father it s cultural madness i think for anyone paying serious attention that this is now a country that unless u are born into a normal healthy productive family u are better off dead and probably will die they could raise minimum wage or outlaw opioids but they don t why it s not that hard or particularly complicated i think this is a calculated decision among the elites to cause massive suicides and drug overdoses as people from those kind of families especially are increasingly no longer needed for their labor and consequently have no logical purpose to exist the system is now set up to kill them on purpose in order to keep things moving and comfortable for the class of people who are doing well under the new chinese american global elite who no longer have a serious use for a western working class especially now that there are no wars u don t even need poor people as manpower to compete with a potential threat

1,watching the ponzi scheme economy  faster than in was scary at first now it s just laughable for how many years have we been convinced by the mainstream media that the economy is legitimate and real gaslighting for year after year about the strength of the economy and strong fundamentals at some point over the past years of repetetive gaslighting i slowly became convinced that the stock market and the economy would get propped up indefinitely until everything d together turns out the entire economy was a house of cards afterall took a matter of weeks to wipe out years worth of gains now the fed is literally printing infinite us dollars our currency still has value because of our entire population being gaslit their entire lives into believing it s worth something wall street investors and large corporations aren t as foolish you can t just magically buy up all the failing unsustainable corporations and expect the value of the currency to hold forever the situation is laughable at this point the economic carnage will be historical
1,questions about d currencies and their actual effect on daily life i can t remember my history lessons regarding the reichsmark or other currencies that essentially d before during after ww those were also not quite like what we face in the future everyone knows that when the usd s the world pretty much stops spinning because that s what everyone else has based their currency on these questions also assume that one isn t prepared for a  like i m sure most of your friends and family are not saying buy gold now is not particularly helpful when a most people just don t see a  happening b gold will have questionable value after a complete currency  c we can t all go buy gold my main question though is what happens at the local level obviously nothing like this has happened before so we can only speculate but still assuming that the  of the usd occurs and all of a sudden every economy in the world is in a tailspin is the usd essentially worthless more useful as toilet paper all of a sudden is your life savings in the bank evaporated do you still have to pay your mortgage your bills to whom with what do you still go to work what are you paid with why would you go to work if you aren t being paid nobody will show up even if offered a million usd because even stupid people know that m x is still following this if nobody is going to work because nobody wants to be paid in worthless paper what happens to infrastructure will there even be anyone to pay your bills to since the electric company is largely automated your power is still on but when the transformers break down who will come to fix them if nobody is going to work how do you buy food or fuel with locals who by the way have no fucking clue what an ounce of gold is worth so good luck with that since our society revolves entirely around money and getting paid if there comes a time when it becomes common knowledge that paper money known as the usd is worthless what happens everyone here talks about going into localized clusters growing your own food etc but eventually those clusters expand as it is human nature and people will quickly tire of the old barter system as a stopgap measure this is where gold comes into play in a lot of people s minds but by this stage where bartering is at its limits and local clusters can no longer expand while supporting themselves remnants of govt have already started to move into a new currency which may or may not be backed by gold those of us without gold where do we pick up from everyone just starts back at all debts and savings wiped clean
1,off my chest there s a certain hypocrisy in the way some people criticize covidiots for many a valid reasons but then lack the self awareness to realize those valid reasons apply beyond the scope of covid i was inspired to write this post after scrolling through a travelling sub i think it s r solotravel many people point out accusingly that those who chose to travel right now are clueless imbeciles spreading the virus never mind i m taking such comments out of context they might very well be emotionally generated thoughts that don t pretend to be absolute truths i ll assume for a second these statements are said as absolute truths and simply focus on the point on which they base their conclusions that such people are idiots and break it down to realize how those points apply to them daily beyond covid the claim is traveling during a pandemic is bad and people who do it knowingly and willingly without a valid reason hear nothing less but a medical emergency are idiots because gt traveling during a pandemic spreads the disease thus contaminating more people which leads to a more deaths and b an undermining of the containment efforts and thus a prolonging of the sanitary crisis this argument is in my opinion completely valid in so much as it is true to a large extent that people who travel using public means participiate in spreading a highly contagious disease the validity of that argument extends far beyond the scope of covid though and that s where i sense a lack of self awareness in real life now and before covid people buy cheap clothes or other stuff which is only possible by exploiting cheap labor at the other side of the world where environmental concerns for industries are minimal the pollution generated by such industries kills many people traveling in general has a very high environmental impact nowadays anyone flying participates in the making of a climate crisis that will kill plenty eating meat depends on the exploitation of monocultures of soy and maize that rely on pesticides and chemicals that sterilize the soil contributing to the greatest unspoken biomass ecocide of human memory etc so many things people do half consciously on a daily basis without taking into consideration the full extent of their implications i could go on but essentially this boils down to a maximalist take on things in life a maximalist would say if there is a pandemic and people traveling spread the pandemic thus harming people then people shouldn t travel okay but it follows that if we live in a society based on exponential growth fueled by consumption of the earth s resources and that such a model harms people people should stop doing that as well and people who still do according to such logic are purely and simply idiots i m not arguing whether it s true or not ie that people who travel during a pandemic and people who participate in the current ecocide are indeed idiots i just want to argue that if one is true so is the other and i ll go on to assume most people who criticize one probably haven t self reflected upon whether the joke was on them
1,you think whichever humans exist in the future will tell legends of this time the time of the fall the time of monsters of a great civilization disappearing to ruin ending in fire fire and death honestly honestly feel that this time will be a basis for some post apocalyptic religion a century from now like hell the future we face sounds like it s straight out of revelations

1,french fuel tax protests are proof that carbon taxes are not a solution without a massive redistribution of wealth people protested in france against the government s gasoline taxes levied as part of an anti pollution effort with dead and hundreds injured compare that to the paltry few thousand who protested in the uk with extinction rebellion to bring attention to the climate change crisis percent of french polled said that their purchasing power is more important than limiting carbon emissions carbon taxes disproportionately impact the poor and working class there must be a concurrent redistribution of wealth the top consume much more than the bottom you cannot with a straight face tell the desperately poor the world over to care about the environment when they don t even have their basic needs met and are one crisis away from homelessness neoliberal policies under capitalism keep so many people working paycheck to paycheck that they are too financially insecure to care about issues bigger than themselves
1,commuting to chicago i m doing an internship at a financial institution in the city this summer days a week i commute via train to the city for work every morning that i ride in i feel a sense of dread deep down not a crushing anxiety but definitely a lot of stress with the thought of oh god i hope nothing happens today the thought of being trapped in a major metropolitan area without a viable means of defense miles away from home virtually unprepared except for my mindset honestly scares me to those of you who also commute like i do how do you deal with it and what do you do to mitigate a potentially terrible situation

1,are my fellow americans ready to rumble virginia is going to be the epicenter of a national civil war there is a bill that is most likely going to pass in virginia that will do the following among other things make most semi automatic rifles illegal to own there is also no grandfather clause to prevent forcible confiscation that are capable of holding or more rounds also banned are shotguns with revolving cylinders pistols with a possible capacity of or more and other things doctor s instead of judges will be able to have people labeled mentally incapable of possessing firearms there are other nasty things feel free to read through the bill itself now why is this an issue well this bill is incredibly unpopular many counties have already declared themselves second amendment sanctuaries they have also voiced a clear intent to resist the confiscations the virginian gov t has shown intent to activate and deploy national guard and or army units to suppress the rebellion your probably wondering why a single incident like this matters if things kick off outsiders will come to help fights may erupt across the country as ng units are activated to go to virginia soldiers wouldn t want to fight their own countrymen some of them would desert and or mutiny this would most likely cause major disruption to our country s infrastructure and their exports imports global trade will be disrupted the us would change forever and other countries may follow suite they may have the blinds opened to their own country s corruption january is the most likely tipping point the question is what will the people do once the dust settles

1,are we on track to wade into a global dark age for about ten years i ve been studying this it s a simplified geographical and chronological map of the totality of the history of human politics for the last years done by some group called schofield and sims it has always struck me because the more i look at it the more i see a pattern a subtle pattern of society that started in the eastern mediterranean has spread to the entire surface of the world and repeats about every to years if i m seeing any real information here then we are in a time of transition a transition into a global dark age the equivalent would be the end of the bronze age eastern mediterranean meta civilization or it would be the beginning of the post roman dark age i try to be as scientific as possible methodical and even then i keep seeing this pattern  is an obvious thing to point out when it really starts to happen but what i m seeing is more subtle the bigger the rise the bigger the fall we have more to lose than the romans our dark age may be a  but i see some kind of mathematics here admittedly i am no mathematician i spend a lot of time thinking about this map and how it could be used to predict an equivalent global dark age assuming the pattern has been spread sociologically i wanted to communicate these thoughts to someone and was wondering specifically what collapsniks would think of this map and the idea of an equivalent dark age

1,a lot of people are far too afraid of criticizing the status quo and accidentally stepping into a political conversation to pin blame for the  correctly i see this very often even in this very subreddit and it s the main reason i m skeptical that most people will ever become aware of the widespread  of civilization many people completely skirt around the discussion of who is responsible for the  because they re afraid of coming to terms with the fact that the current state of global economics resulted in this outcome instead they try to shame endpoint consumers for feeding money into companies that injure the environment rather than hold those companies accountable for actively choosing to do something that injures the environment themselves not only is it victim blaming it s scientifically unsound a trust in empirical thinking is the only reason any of us even believe in climate change to begin with

1,you d have to plant and grow an entire amazon rainforest every years to offset carbon emissions quote while working in the amazon i decided to start running some calculations of just how important the deforestation problem and its converse planting for carbon offets were i got out an envelope and started doing my proverbial calculations on the back figurative witticism actually i worked in a spreadsheet i calculated the biomass of biomass is carbon of the entire amazon roughly million square kilometers naturally forested think the u s including alaska added in every bit of carbon i could come up with from leaf to root and all the soil carbon i took the fossil fuel emissions levels of that period and divided it into the total carbon in the amazon i just couldn t believe the numbers so i tried everything i could think of to correct them but kept coming up with the same numbers so i rang up one of the world s leading experts on carbon emissions who worked at the institution that employed me at the time whrc and had him look over the numbers bottom line was that he agreed with my calculations the take home message was that at that time the entire stock of amazonian carbon equalled only years of our collective fossil fuel emissions i haven t gone back to revisit those calculations since but the fossil fuel emissions have gone up substantially while the biomass of the amazon has increased relatively slightly i support reduced emissions through deforestation and degradation redd but we are simply not going to be able to plant our way out of this at rates we d have to somehow create new amazon forests every years to offset all emissions clearly impossible does this mean it is useless to plant trees no they have lots of uses and will help ameliorate carbon issues but they are not going to be a huge part of emissions reductions going forward there are no silver bullets we have a lot of hard decisions and harder work ahead of us source note reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd is a mechanism that has been under negotiation by the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc since with the objective of mitigating climate change through reducing net emissions of greenhouse gases through enhanced forest management in developing countries in other words planting more trees to offset deforestation source thread mark cochrane bio peak prosperity podcast with professor mark cochrane

1,how does your country cope with the corona virus in the netherlands the first cases of the corona virus have landed in a period in which carnaval and a number of other big events have taken place the media over here claims that asymptotic people cannot spread the virus at all this has made me curious about the messages other infected counties are spreading i m just curious about how other countries cope with the virus does your government try to calm the population by claiming the virus to be perhaps less infectious than it could be or does your government actually warn you to not participate in certain events and is there even a way to be sure about the stages in which the virus could spread in the netherlands all coming events coming weeks will not be cancelled at least for now the schools and practically every business will also open like nothing has happened i m just worried that my government tries to keep the population away from panic by making risky assumptions what does your country tell you to do and what to avoid

1,early potato harvest farmers in my area were able to plant potatoes a full month ahead of normal due to early warm temperatures and a warmer than normal growing season this will mean an early harvest when the weather is too hot for harvesting potatoes excessive heat can cause lower yields misshapen tubers and defects like hollow heart farmers can use irrigation to cool the soil but that means increased disease from the increased moisture around here farmers are talking about harvesting at night to avoid the production losses associated with harvesting in intense heat managing crops in extreme heat is much more difficult and inevitably means lost production

1,it is extremely obvious from space that all civilisations  i am a firm believer that the problem of the so called fermi paradox i e why is space so quiet is entirely down to the fact that all advanced civilisations rapidly destroy themselves i used to think the great filter was a star distribution problem i e advanced civilisations are on average separated by s of light years at distances so far that emitted radio signals fade into background noise by the time they reach the nearest civilisation but then i realised that we as a species have emitted large radio burst messages that are capable of reaching far distances for instance the arecibo message and we have ejected two physical craft from our solar system the voyager s if our civilisation was to last for thousands of years it is likely we would end up emitting a huge amount of radio emissions and physical objects over the duration from our behaviour we can deduce that most advanced alien civilisations are likely to also emit a large amount of radio data and physical objects therefore in theory the universe should be littered with alien radio bursts and space trash i understand that alien space trash is likely very hard to come by even in a civilisation packed universe due to the vastness of the universe but radio emissions should in theory be easily detected the absence of evidence of advanced alien life to me in a universe packed with potentially habitable planets says that civilisation likely rapidly destroys itself in all cases especially considering there have been many more stars older than our sun so the quietness cannot probably be explained by the theory we are the first during the whole civilisation expansion technological orgy process it is likely that a civilisation fires out a few radio beams and a few craft but these simply get lost in the vastness of space civilisations pop up every or so light years distance on new star systems every so often but they rapidly destroy themselves perhaps the default universe civilisation story is that civilisation destroys itself way earlier than we do on average perhaps as soon as the nuke is invented or even before we could be an extremely rare case i even thought this when thinking about pandemics for instance it is a complete and utter miracle that despite the incredible movements of people around the globe these past years and the contacts with animals we have had that a pandemic has not ensued until covid if one thinks about it in a crowded and busy world a pandemic should be the norm not the exception we rolled the dice a thousand times and always got s this theory of inevitable  perhaps shows us that there are limits to growth and we won t end up with the fusion powered star trek future some envisage to me the universe is showing us that  is inevitable it is now entirely a timing issue

1,economic failures of the ipcc process steve keen but the main weaknesses with the ipcc s methodology are firstly that in economics it exclusively selects neoclassical economists and secondly because there is no built in review of one discipline s findings by another the conclusions of these neoclassical economists about the dangers of climate change are reviewed only by other neoclassical economists the economic sections of ipcc reports are therefore unchallenged by other disciplines who also contribute to the ipcc s reports given the extent to which economists dominate the formation of most government policies in almost all fields and not just strictly economic policy fourcade et al hirschman and berman christensen lazear the otherwise acceptable process by which the ipcc collates human knowledge on climate change has critically weakened rather than strengthened human society s response to climate change this is because commencing with nobel laureate mirowski william nordhaus the economists who specialise on climate change have falsely trivialized the dangers that climate change poses to human civilization this sanguine assessment of the costs of climate change contrasts starkly with the non economic sections of ipcc reports the recent global warming of c report for example predicted that of insects and of mammals would lose or more of their range at c warren et al p yet the economic components of ipcc reports concur with nordhaus that damages from climate change will be slight the executive summary of chapter of the fifth assessment key economic sectors and services opens with the declaration that for most economic sectors the impact of climate change will be small relative to the impacts of other drivers medium evidence high agreement changes in population age income technology relative prices lifestyle regulation governance and many other aspects of socioeconomic development will have an impact on the supply and demand of economic goods and services that is large relative to the impact of climate change arent et al a p how can such relatively small estimates of economic damages be reconciled with the large impacts that scientists expect on critical components of the biosphere the answer is that they can t because the economic studies are not based on the scientific assessments of damage from climate change instead the numerical estimates of the impact of climate change on gdp have been made up by economists themselves i use the expression made up advisedly because there is no more accurate way to characterise how neoclassical economists have approached climate change before i explain how these spurious estimates were manufactured it is useful to contrast them with some of the more easily understood dangerous consequences of a higher global average temperature a critical feature of human physiology is our ability to dissipate internal heat by perspiration to do so the external air needs to be colder than our ideal body temperature of about c and dry enough to absorb our perspiration as well this becomes impossible when the combination of heat and humidity known as the wet bulb temperature exceeds c above this level we are unable to dissipate the heat generated by our bodies and the accumulated heat will kill a healthy individual within three hours scientists have estimated that a c increase in the global average temperature would make jakarta s temperature and humidity combination permanently fatal for humans while a c increase would mean that even new york would experience days per year when the combination of temperature and humidity would be deadly mora et al figure p source look on the bright side wet bulb temperatures will be humane and efficient in our demise

1,hey writing a book about a possible alternative to the forthcoming information age  hi all i m writing a book about a very detailed solution to all of our current problems by using a deep understanding of what s causing them here s the prologue people we re fucked i mean like reeeaaaally fucked i m writing this at the tail end of we are in the midst of a global pandemic due to which many people have restricted their lives leading to a drop in carbon emissions in spite of all this is shaping up to be if not the top at least in the top warmest years on record climate change isn t coming it s here it s not just the climate though income inequality is the highest it s been in years political polarization is at levels not seen since the last civil war which is keeping us from foreseeing the upcoming thucydides trap and employment crisis due to automation human civilization is rushing headlong into a cyberpunk dystopia if we don t do something and fast then we can kiss this long peace goodbye now i m not the only one to think this even mainstream news outlets have caught on that the jig is coming to an end plenty of people are looking to solve our current problems through ideological means the revitalized american left seems mainly to think that through electoralism they can shift american policy enough to avoid the impending climate catastrophe to put that in perspective the ipcc says that to mitigate the worst effect of climate change on human society we should limit warming to above preindustrial levels that is not to avoid climate change that s just to mitigate the worst effects was above preindustrial levels the wmo says that we will hit above preindustrial levels by to be honest given the current geopolitical situation we can kiss our nice stable climate goodbye that doesn t mean that there s no hope it just means we have to switch the current paradigm of thinking around climate change the current idea is that we will get all the nations on earth to drastically reduce their co emissions and keep them down not only does this require levels of global cooperation never before seen but it also disproportionately benefits rich countries who have the money to transition to cleaner fuels that s just for the climate issue instead of relying on a moonshot that the world is consistently making more and more infeasible i propose a different approach instead of waiting for governments to change i propose we change instead of hoping that the climate doesn t change i propose we change so that it doesn t matter if we re are not only going to survive but thrive in the next years then we need to with intention plan out a route from our current catastrophe through sustainability the lands us in a promising future we can create a better society we have to create a better society one that can stand up to the problems of climate change and wealth inequality and finally secure a basic livelihood for all to do this we need to realize that there are two major fronts that demand attention and intention that being the technical issues of how to build a climate change resistant sustainable society and the epistemological how to organize that society sustainable equitably and such that it doesn t  now this book is strictly meant to deal with the technological side of this issue though if you subscribe to certain sociological theories then the technological mode of production implies a certain sociological structure this book is more of an introduction to the types of solutions we could apply to the problem of work and non sustainable production i have limited my scope to make the task manageable however this means that not everyone can partake in the society that i am laying out i don t take this to mean that there is not a sustainable solution for all it just means that i cannot as an individual find it i propose that the approach i take in this book can be applied by others to their own circumstances to produce similar results resources full bibliography in final book i m publishing it in parts on medium if you want to check it out
1,service economies are ridiculous in my european country we prefer to refer to a service economy as a knowledge economy pretending that the value added by people in the tertiary sector is actually produced by our elite monopoly on knowledge which we acquired by paying a lot of money to go to college for four years however regardless of whatever western country you might live in chances are you re not producing anything that the rest of the world really needs we produce things that we manage to fool each other into believing are worth something a cup of coffee for which you pay ten dollar because the barista is willing to strike up smalltalk with you is the oil of our economy considering that americans spend of their gdp on healthcare and yet have a life expectancy lower than that of the south koreans who spend just it should be clear that americans don t deliver a superior product in this regard american health care is not state of the art and your frequent doctor visits don t lead you to superior health in a culture that sees job creator as a honorific rather than as an insult sickness is a product that can be turned into a profit and keep the economy running if doctors started preventing illness and pharmaceuticals stopped causing side effects that lead to the need for more treatment the economy would not survive as people would lose their jobs poor health has become an expression of patriotism as every new roll of fat we grow keeps hardworking american doctors dietitians insurance salesmen and gym owners employed the war on terror has accomplished its objective and should be superseded by a war on fruit and vegetables we in the west might consider ourselves creators of culture our most insidious export product to the rest of the world but that too is of limited duration we might think that we can sustain an entire creative class of hipsters because one out of every thousand has a drug trip that leads them to produce some new genre of music or art house film that we can export to the third world but they re not particularly interested in funding our insanity and bourgeois ennui we might consider ourselves cultural leaders but the third world has no motive to keep our self imposed illusion going chinese people are capable of dancing around in ridiculous costumes on stage and singing sentimental love songs too they don t need us for that we don t have to export the fictionalized relationship drama of upper class brooklynite women in their twenties to china either as they themselves are perfectly capable of coming up with relationship drama of rich young daughters of party officials living in beijing or shanghai the emperor has no clothes our service economies are little more than a hot potato game of white people serving each other coffee legal advice to deal with the complex laws we set up for ourselves mortgages education insurances and medical care until the developing world figures out that they don t really have a good reason to keep our busywork going and reinforcing our purchasing power by buying dollars and debt anymore and decide to crash our economy

1,psychiatric medication withdrawal addiction during the  of civilization psych meds are designed to quickly alter aka damage the brain peripheral nervous system endocrine system and severely alter sexual and emotional functioning often times long term antidepressants stimulants anti anxiety medication and antipsychotics are all classified by profound withdrawal effects that can be permanent if the person takes them for more than weeks and then does not correctly taper when getting off usually requires a minimum of months to taper correctly many people who are currently taking these drugs have absolutely no idea how profound the effects to their body actually is and only upon stopping the drugs is the damage revealed it s well established that society is going to  but the form in which this  takes and the speed at which it occurs are up to debate regardless of this getting off the drugs when the  finally does happen is goign to be a nightmare as many people who run out of the drugs in days will literally have seizures full out psychotic events one of the most common withdrawal effects of antispycotic drugs is profound psychosis as this is actually a side effect of taking the drugs and nervous breakdowns those that survive the acute withdrawal effects will suffer post acute withdrawals possibly for many years to follow there is considerable evidence among anecdotal reports that psych meds specifically the antidepressants and antipsychotics literally cause nerve and brain damage in some people and a too rapid taper can potentiate these long term effects another thing to keep in mind about antidepressants in particular is the fact that long term or permanent sexual dysfunction is fairly common along with long term damage to the emotional part of the brain and memory this manifests as your family member seeming different and sort of flat lined and just unenthusiastic etc these side effects do not always go away when the drug is stopped but very few people can actually manage to get off the drug to determine whether or not they have long term damage because the acute withdrawal effects are so severe often times people think the original symptoms are coming back with a vengeance but in reality these are just withdrawal effects that seem like the original symptom my advice proven brain damaging drugs with horrendous withdrawals will be a tremendous liability when society begins to  not having them in your bloodstream when this happens should be your first priority i would suggest slowly taper these over a period of months and never take another pill moreover if you get off the drugs and try to get back on them you can experience a kindling reaction which can even further damage your brain so please keep that in mind when you come off once you re off it s not safe to go back on it s really a roll of the dice sure your original symptoms may return but anxiety and depression are extremely healthy symptoms considering the fact that society is literally about to  and billions of your fellow humans are about to die from starvation and dehydration if you manage to get off these drugs yes you may suffer from long term nerve and brain damage from the side effects of the drugs but if you can get through the actue withdrawal phase before the  you will stand a much better chance of survival than the of the public that is currently taking one of the above mentioned drugs remember all antispycotics antideprssants anti anxiety medication mood stabilizers and adhd medication or stimulants are well established to have severe withdrawal effects if they are not tapered slowly over many weeks to months the most well established withdrawals are in stimulants benzodiazapines and antidepressants once society begins to rapidly deteriorate chances are very low that the supply of psychiatric medications many of which are manufactured in asian countries and shipped overseas will have any supply remaining pharmacies have very low supplies of these drugs at any given time if there was a run on the pharmacies there may not even be a single pill for every patient now is the time to begin tapering these drugs if you wish to have any quality of life and any chance of survival once the beginning phases of the societal  and the near term extinction event begin to unfold remember the entire system is not going to suddenly  overnight you re going to still be alive for a while perhaps a couple of years check out a few of these forums witness anecdotal reports that big pharma does not want anyone to see moreover these websites provide excellent instructions for how to correctly taper these drugs that your doctor most likely is not aware of as doctors generally do not recognize any of these withdrawal effects as they are not taught it in medical school which are funded by big pharma as are the texbooks written by big pharma as are the peer reviewed journals ghost written by big pharma the whole system is corrupted antidepressants anti anxiety drugs stimulants tldr psych meds all cause severe withdrawal effects if they are not tapered over many weeks to months you need to understand how to correctly taper do your research and start now this is not a quick process there is only a roughly day supply of these drugs possibly less those who do not prepare correctly are going to suffer far worse than the average unprepared person in society disclaimer this is not medical advice just a general personal opinion you should consult with your doctor about coming off of these extremely powerful and mind altering medications as they are incredibly potent and if not withdrawn from properly can cause serious brain injury and or self harm or harm to others consult with your doctor first before making any changes this entire post is just my personal opinion i am not a medical doctor and do not claim to be making such advice that being said societal  is imminent and if your doctor does not understand the threats facing society you should strongly consider finding an open minded but knowledgeable doctor that can best guide you in preparing for the  of civilization

1,could the total  of human civilization actually be humanity s salvation discussion as the title says what are your thoughts there s no right or wrong answer i personally think it would be our salvation if the major social political and economic systems in place on our planet d most of humanity s populations that depend on these systems for survival would die off because they d be unable to adept to a way of living back in the wild so to speak this would be especially evident in urban populations where city dwellers whose lives are thoroughly entrenched in city living suddenly find themselves without the social support systems keeping them safe fed and with a roof over their heads complete anarchy and a massive decrease in urban populations would mean less resource consumption and give the earth s biomes time to regenerate without human intervention nature would eventually overtake and reclaim our cities like what can be seen in chernobyl the survivors would go by a rule of survival of the fittest and new human populations would rise with better survivalist traits and more natural resources at their disposal i could be wrong though what do you guys think
1,global warming can t the elites just move to colder areas i don t understand the hoopla over global warming someone said temp rising by six celsius degrees will end civilization well that s bad news for polar bears and penguins but not for today s winners since most pundits live in the us east cost london and other major cities they are not aware that there are quite a lot of land currently covered by permafrost and are virtually empty siberia is bigger than western europe and america combined and without permafrost it can support quite a lot of people it will take some work to drain the swamps eliminate the mosquitoes and make the land farmable but with the massive fertilizers etc being shipped to the third world to feed billion people in there now if they are shipped to there these areas will be farmable patagonia southern chile and even artificial islands in what used to be the arctic and large portions of antarctica will also help as well sure it is disrupting and will change a lot of things and many of the settlers won t survive however it is not going to be the end of the world it will probably shift global pecking order with russia and some nordic countries at the top of the heap due to their long history of working in the cold climates the inuits will probably go the way of the sioux since their lands will have to be claimed for civilization sorry

1,am i crazy i grew up in the s and s and i used to go on about global warning the unsustainability of cities and the ability of viruses to mutate on all accounts i was told i was basically crazy and told my concerns were unfounded i have recently found another issue which has me concerned yet when i post to any of the science subreddit s i am downvoted without comment maybe someone here can critique my reasoning and tell me if i am crazy i believe we may be in the midst of a speciation event humans may be changing precocious or early onset puberty is becoming a serious medical concern in many countries a quick google search can confirm this there is a consensus that this is related to the obesity epidemic to remain objective here is an article refuting early onset puberty this article suggest that there is no evidence to support to see this as a trend going back to middle ages and the beginning of the mass migration to cities i don t agree but whatever moving on here is a virus that has been linked to obesity it is one of the virus s that cause the common cold and bronchitis there are also no cures for adenovirus infection early onset puberty linked to obesity obesity linked to a common and incurable virus although a vaccine has proven effective in mice a significant change in when we start puberty is a change in developmental rates a change of developmental rates neoteny has been accepted as a mechanism for evolution so do you think i m crazy for being concerned about this that humans may be in the midst of a speciation event that would unfold over the next few generations

1,climate change is the best thing ever for humanity it s like a perfect virus with a infection rate engineered to give its host natural and permanent immunity to all deadly diseases in one go if the host can survive everything that s currently wrong with human civilization unfettered growth consumption and development short sighted greed xenophobia and constant war pollution and waste reliance on antiquated sources of energy repression and inequality will need to change if we want to survive and that s the best part our very survival is at stake because you know the only way we ll look up from our smartphones and actually do something is if someone or something points a gun at our heads our energy infrastructure will need a total overhaul no more oil gas or coal only durable low emissions technologies with a minimal environmental footprint like solar or nuclear fusion forget fission the inevitable sudden and massive loss of biodiversity arable soil and fish stocks will require us to espouse a sustainable first principle in everything we do because the underlying dynamics of climate change are complex and difficult to understand we can no longer get away with having a large class of uneducated worker bees we will need to immunize everyone to propaganda by training them to think like scientists so they aren t intimidated by scientific information and can analyze claims to their own satisfaction rather than relying on shills to tell them what s what overcoming climate change is going to require a total and bottom up political and cultural transformation our corrupt elite will need to step down voluntarily for a new generation of leaders or be dragged out of their castles kicking and screaming more likely the latter in which case the militarization of our police mass surveillance and drones will prove to be difficult but surmountable obstacles once the dust settles we ll think twice about allowing power to concentrate like this again and because it affects everyone of all nationalities rich or poor smart or dumb it s going to force all of us to finally get on the same page we re humans and earth is our home we re all going to have to become better people and take action wherever we can all of us oh except most of the work and resources are going to have to come from the developed world we enjoyed great progress and prosperity thanks to our use of fossil energy but we ve reached our limit and now we re the only ones with the means to mobilize the massive amount of resources needed to help developing countries eradicate disease feed and educate their people and reach modernity without relying on fossil energy like we did think of it like an inversion of imperialism a comprehensive benevolent cooperative outreach to the global south so i don t know about you guys but i m pretty optimistic about all of the stuff i see posted here we re enrolled in mother nature s shape up or ship out program we either adapt and become truly great or we get buried in the fossil record like we deserve in the hopes that future sentient beings on this planet will dig us up and learn from our mistakes rather than burn us up to fuel yet another apocalypse of course the odds of us surviving are like close to zero it s going to take a collective miracle to get us through this but that s a good thing too we ll need a truly heroic story to impress our kids with an enduring sense of responsibility for our planet so that they don t repeat this stupid shit all over again how do you guys feel

1,til the brazilian rain forests are burning because china need soybeans no matter what the cost as seen on desdemona despair small american farmers are nearing extinction they re trying to wipe us off the map from the article gt president trump s trade war hasn t helped matters after the united states slapped tariffs on chinese goods including steel and aluminum last year china retaliated with percent tariffs on agricultural imports from the u s china then turned to other countries such as brazil to replace american soybeans and corn now i get it the folks in brazil are no dummies china is where its at better get busy clearing more land for soybeans and look at what is ultimately driving american farmers to suicide gt farm debt at billion is at an all time high more than half of all farmers have lost money every year since since and lost more than this year farm loan delinquencies are rising the rentier class would rather make a buck than feed our worthless asses what an incredibly insane clown world we live in
1,the grave implications of sars cov pre face i am not an epidemiologist or a doctor i feel the implications of this virus are more terrifying than most governments and media are openly acknowledging look at sars or mers they are coronaviruses with fatality rates given how easily sars cov spreads due to its asymptomatic pre symptomatic spreading and long pre symptomatic period i feel that humanity really lucked out that this virus has only a fatality rate if this was as deadly as sars or mers it would be absolutely apocalyptic we have had novel coronaviruses in less than decades and each time we were rolling the dice the first times were deadly but not so contagious and the rd was contagious but not so deadly as populations grow with lax regulations on food standards and exponentially increasing international travel how many more times will we roll the dice until we get a deadly and contagious virus how many more coronaviruses are we going to have over the next years based off our track record i am guessing atleast new coronaviruses before how long until we get the one that hits the world like the plague i hope this is a massive wake up call for the world to get its act together but i am not confident that we will learn this virus has hit us hard in terms of loss of life and economic damage but i am afraid in years from now only the economic damage will be remembered and the lesson will be not to do lockdowns etc not how to actually change our society to prevent another pandemic for example canada was hit hard by sars in the early s like parts of east asia and our government constantly told us they were prepared for this coronavirus and we can see now that was not true can we really trust the world as a whole to learn its lesson when certain countries are still arguing if this is just a flu some countries want to dismantle the who with no alternative instead of trying to reform it to fix the deficiencies my prediction based off of the conflicts between china and the us is the world will split into a multi polar world where trade and people still move but multilateralism s if we have no cooperation globally to set regulations and manage outbreaks of diseases the likelihood of another pandemic becomes even more grim of course the elephant in the room is our massive consumption of meat whether from wildlife or through farming how many novel swine flus and avian flus jump to humans every year from agriculture how many billions of people in asia south america and africa are going to become new consumers of meat as they develop cutting down trees in indonesia and brazil in the process new farms animals will intermingle with displaced native animals e g bats with billions of meat eaters and people flying around the world it is really a matter of time i am gravely concerned with climate change but i think it is clear to me that a disease will probably be our undoing
1,a fantastic description of the problem i watched this documentary the best takeaway from it was a description of the problem with humans we have a limited pool of worry our ability to concern ourselves with problems is limited and for the majority of people bills mortgage food living working general problems take up all of our day to day concerns climate change is not only too big but anything not immediately threatening our interests is put on the back burner obviously now it is becoming a real issue with real visible effects everyone is waking up from a year slumber and looking at something we were toldwould happen way back then this is the great filter there is such a slim chance of making it past this problem i just know we aren t going to turn it round in time all the runaway feedback cycles are kicking in its so much worse than we are being told unless some major technological breakthrough happens its all over this experiment on earth called humanity is finished its not a case of stopping it now its turning the supertanker around its going to take decades to slow and even longer to reverse this is over years of carbon dumped into the atmosphere with a decade to fix before feedback is unstoppable and i believe we are already there

1,true spiritual awakening happens when you come to the knowledge of the truth watch this video 
1,some interesting words from adam curtis who gave us the century of the self and hypernormalization you ask what real change might look like that is a really interesting question for liberals and radicals because there is a hunger for change out there among millions of people who feel sort of insecure and uncertain about the future and do want something do want that to change i think that change only comes from a big imaginative idea a sort of picture of another kind of future which gives people which connects with that fearfulness in the back of people s minds and offers them a release from it that s the key thing but i think that the question for liberals and radicals is that they are always suspicious of big ideas that s what lurks underneath the liberal mindset and the reason is and they re quite right in a way is look what happened last time when millions of people got swept up in a big idea look up the last hundred years of what happened in russia and then in germany the point is that change political change is frightening it s scary it s thrilling because it is dynamic and is doing something to change the world but it is scary because it can change things in ways where nothing is secure it s like being in an earthquake even the solid ground underneath you begins to move and things dissolve that you think are solid and real and i think that question liberals and the left have to face at the moment is a really sort of a difficult question which is do you really want change do you really want it because if you do many of them might find themselves in a very uncertain world where they might lose all sorts of things i mean what we re talking about in many cases is people who are the sort at the center of society at the moment they re not out of the margins they would have a lot to lose from real political change because it really would change things in the structure of power or and this is the brutal question do you just want things to change a little do you just want the banks to be a little bit nicer say or people to be a little more respectful of each other s identities all which is good but basically you carry on living in a nice world where you tinker with it that s the key question but you can t just sit there forever worrying about big ideas because there are millions of people out there who do want change and the key thing is they feel they ve got nothing to lose you might have lots to lose but they feel they ve got absolutely nothing to lose but at the moment they re being led by the right so things won t remain the same but society may go off in ways that you really don t want in answer to your question what you need is a powerful vision of the future with all it s dangers but it s also quite thrilling it would be an escape from the staticness of the world we have today and to do that you ve got to engage with the giant forces of power that now run the world at the moment in confronting those powers and trying to transform the world you might lose a lot this is a sort of forgotten idea is that actually you surrender yourself up to a big idea and the process you might lose something but you d actually gain in a bigger sense because you ve changed the world for the better i know it sounds soppy but sort of this is the forgotten thing about politics is that you give up some of your individualism to something bigger than yourself you surrender yourself and it s a lost idea and i think really in answer to your question is you can spot real change happening when you see people from the liberal middle classes beginning to give themselves up to something surrender themselves to something bigger than themselves and at the moment there is nothing like that in the liberal imagination adam curtis interview with will menaker

1,the evidence tells me we have breached the tipping point for the desertification of brazil gt the tipping point sampaio and his colleagues modeled suggested that once of the amazon was deforested this natural water pump would be broken and the so called aerial rivers would stop flowing gt today of the amazon is already clear cut another is degraded selectively cut to different extents that adds up to pretty close to the calculated tipping point even if we consider the unavoidable uncertainties which we know can cut both ways the agreement between prediction and observation is worth serious attention gt let s not forget that the amazon also had two once in a century droughts in and the second one was especially severe in the west southwest part of the amazon that is the region farthest from the ocean and most dependent on the moisture recycling process gt the bottom line gt it is one thing to think of climate change as an abstract idea it is another thing to see it with your own eyes and then only then really ponder about the consequences societies are formed to make the best use of existing resources including the climate less rain means losses and suffering to people not to mention drastic ecological consequences i don t imagine that more rain would be of much use either it s not that we had the ideal amount we just built our cities and farms to match the existing climate changing everything would be costly both in an economic and a human way gt we know the climate is a chaotic system and changes may not come gradually we still don t have data to claim with certainty that this is a sample of what s coming nor do we know with certainty what causes to attribute this to it may be the deforestation maybe global climate change or something else however when you start messing with a chaotic system like this you can expect the unexpected gt it s just not wise to mess with something as important as this if we don t fully know how it works and how it will behave the same study recomends not only a total halt on deforestation but also an urgent effort in reforestation i do hope policymakers listen to this drought and deforestation in brazil the feast or famine flooding like in the piracicaba river are a classic sign of what has been predicted would happen to the global hydrologic cycle from manmade global warming gt climate change will also lead to changes in global rainfall patterns intensifying both droughts and floods across the globe the clausius clapeyron equation dictates that the saturation vapor pressure of water increases nearly exponentially with temperature therefore a warmer atmosphere will allow for more evaporation of water and an intensification of the hydrologic cycle leading to increases in rainfall in some regions and decreases in others at the present rainfall has increased in the mid and high latitudes and in the tropics while it has decreased in the sub tropics if global average temperature increases by c dry season precipitation in northern africa southern europe and western australia is projected to decrease by and that in the southwestern united states eastern south america and southern africa to decrease by which will have a profound impact on crop productivity and water resources for comparison the american dust bowl in the s was the result of a decrease in rainfall over a decade a reduction in mountain snow pack and glaciers will also exacerbate stresses on water resources climate change is also predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as hurricanes heat waves heavy precipitation events and flooding additionally if global average temperature increases by c approximately of plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction as in the case of rising sea level these consequences of climate change are irreversible on a year timescale because temperature increases caused by elevated co are expected to persist for that time period even if carbon emissions are fully curtailed solomon et al ipcc link

1,the  why even try anymore we recognize our downfall and all the reasons why but everyday we do the same thing if everything just stopped we would be forced to carry things out differently ex one person not going to work won t do anything but the whole country there s enough people that could sit out and do absolutely nothing if they truly don t enjoy what s happening right now that you can handicap negative actions of others and force change without doing anything people are trying to hard to take action and create change when you really just have to take no action
1,ocean acidification the worst issue of climate change for millions of years perhaps longer the ocean has maintained a very stable ph the measure of acid or base in a substance that measure is or rather was increasingly it looks like the oceans are dissolving large amounts of atmospheric co which is a clear process following very basic chemistry toward acidification one can consider how adding c to a soda beverage makes for example coca cola into an acid that can de rust an old piece of metal it appears that ocean acid base or sometimes acid alkaline have moved close to is a neutral measure anything under is an acid like a great deal of earth s non desert soils bleach is a strong alkaline but acidification is what is killing coral thereby causing it to bleach in the sun we know from aquariums and close systems that the base or alkaline nature of seawater is crucial to sea life and other oceanic processes the earth is ocean of all planetary water is saltwater no one can say with certainty but if the ocean ph tends toward or even lower the implications appear catastrophic at levels far beyond sea rise and storms beyond changes to soils environments etc the actual biosystem of the earth would be forever changed undoubtedly this little discussed element of climate change may be its most terrifying
1,agriculture as the mechanism of  this is a self post because i don t have a link or sources merely a question i am seeing arguments propose a slow  where agricultural systems and culture can be retained in order to prevent humanity from starving to death but this misses the fact that plenty of societies have gotten along just fine provided they kept their populations in check with their surroundings where this system breaks down seems to be when an agricultural society with rigid hierarchies and high population invades and upends the hunter gatherer order this happened in europe not long before romans began being a common feature the story of pastoralists wandering meat eaters vs boom bust cycle agriculturalists is told in the bible so it is a known concept from antiquity the story played out again when the agricultural societies of europe swept over the purely human scale native american and australian societies what would history look like if there had been no americas to discover the resource diversity and density of these continents was a stupendous surprise for a crowded europe desperate with excess seventh sons and starving peasants the americas were a great boon to chinese society who saw a population explosion with the introduction of yams and corn when the low density americas were found starvation and  of european civilization was prevented no spain would never have been the power it became without the gold from south america i worry that in limiting our view of viable systems to agriculture we are dooming ourselves to further  should nations or states survive our impending  i am inspired by the example of the plains indians who lived brutal lives under the sun filled with pain and endurance hunting the buffalo free every day of their life in a way we cannot imagine i am inspired by the example of the tlingit in southeast alaska who to this day practice subsistence fishing in villages hundreds of years old i am inspired by the native example because they still value clean water above gold to this day they value personal freedom over extended artificial lines of power there is an emphasis that the world actually has enough to offer which is not present in the agricultural train of thought in agriculture there is never enough time in a day never enough rain never enough sunlight never enough land there can always be more of everything it is wise to produce excess and store it to sell it all of it right now because next season may be a famine and when times are tough you can send your sons off to pillage the neighboring land destroy any native food webs till up the ground and start the cycle all over again until we end up with the artificially exploded population we have today existing on an increasingly untenable agricultural system left with shadows of the former biodiversity available before deforestation and the plow would we be better off without agriculture

1,how long do you think would it take for society to go crazy if a big blackout happens i m talking especially about usa and europe here most people that i know here in austria in my highschool can t even function properly like a human being when their smartphone is taken away from them i feel like we have become so weak i m not saying i m much better after a few days i would also feel the addiction to all these devices but i have the feeling that this would only be the beginning if there is really no energy no food no internet for a few weeks i think many people would go crazy especially at my age like i can t tell you how many times some random guy for example talked to me about raping women as some sort of joke maybe we austrians are especially fucked i don t know but this can t be normal when there s a break i have heard such talks just being spoken casually like talking about the weather you know sarah imagine just owning her like a slave bitch haha lol what will become of these people when their life gets really hard when they have to survive they are crazy right now when everything is still easy
1,shortly after the  what would happen so my question is a theoretical one and i don t know if i am writing in the right subreddit i m quite new to reddit so please have patience well i have started to write some time ago and my book would be about a special szenario imagine you are in a small village living near some bigger city suddenly you wake up one weekend realizing that you don t have electricity there is a general black out and even your cellphone stopped working and the day passes on and you still don t have any electricity nor other working hightech item the real reason why this happened you can t really find out at home because you don t have any information sources what would you do how would it interfere with your daily life and most important would you like it edit idea is about a collapsing of the power grid due to an occurence with the electromagnetic field overcharge during the  until the shield is up again or maybe one of those famous greater windstorms what fascinates me of this idea is how ignorant you of your situation are you think the power will come back but it doesn t and at what point do you believe there is seriously something wrong here pd it doesn t matter where your country is and what kind of village

1,aerosols are masking more warming than was previously thought study suggests warning i advise against reading this post if you are in a fragile emotional state a new paper came out on the negative forcing of aerosols if you are unfamiliar this is what gets called global dimming our industrial activities release compounds like so that act as a cooling force for the earth this new paper suggests that the amount of warming masked by aerosols is around degree celsius that would mean we ve already warmed the earth c since pre industrial as we begin to cut our emissions especially from coal we will experience rapid warming as aerosols disappear from the atmosphere and along with it the cooling effect
1,a poem for our times by william butler yeats the second coming amp xb turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon cannot hear the falconer things fall apart the centre cannot hold mere anarchy is loosed upon the world the blood dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity amp xb surely some revelation is at hand surely the second coming is at hand the second coming hardly are those words out when a vast image out of spiritus mundi troubles my sight somewhere in sands of the desert a shape with lion body and the head of a man a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun is moving its slow thighs while all about it reel shadows of the indignant desert birds the darkness drops again but now i know that twenty centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle and what rough beast its hour come round at last slouches towards bethlehem to be born amp xb the lines i highlighted in bold really describe the global situation in particularly in the us things really are falling apart and the center cannot hold the center being at least right now the us mere anarchy has been loosed upon the world in the form of the george floyd riots the widening gyre representing how the us and the world is spiraling further into oblivion and mayhem the best of humanity the climate scientists environmentalists artists writers humanists those seeking justice lack all conviction while the worst like trump putin xi jinping etc are full of passionate intensity twenty centuries years i find it interesting that yeats believed that history moves in cycles and that the world and the universe have a soul or collective essence very transcendentalist but you could say the soul of america is sick and depraved twisted and self destructive what do you guys think

1,far right in germany 
1,solutions to the crisis in affordable housing as all of you living in your vehicles are aware we re in the midst of a crisis in affordable housing but don t worry because the powers that be are working on solutions the main solution proposed by the powers that be is of course more economic growth in other words don t make homes less expensive make increasingly expensive homes affordable with the promise of eternal economic growth forever and ever this isn t working of course but don t count on the powers that be to mention it but there s another proposed solution which is somewhat extraordinary and quite surprising this author has seen over and over a very peculiar proposal toward making housing more affordable the solution is increase the supply of unaffordable housing this so called solution is being actively applied in many cities such as portland oregon to some people such as children and foolish idealists this sounds a bit counterintuitive but it s perfectly sensible we are told by rational grown ups it s a matter of supply and demand if we create a surplus of unaffordable housing then other housing will start to become affordable in other words by building housing that only wealthy people can afford affordability will trickle down to the rest of us this sounds a lot like the myth of trickle down economics this myth doesn t work either this myth has been officially debunked i m referring to a recent article in oregon business magazine which estimates that rental units in portland remain vacant yet the city continues to encourage the construction of huge housing complexes huge expensive housing complexes has this helped with affordability well not really according to oregon business it has j but only by percent l and that not too impressive percent reduction was concentrated at the luxury end of the market which means that the solution to create more affordable housing for low income people actually created more affordable housing for the wealthy if you imagine that this revelation has caused the city to realize that the myth is bogus then you re either a child or a foolish idealist children and foolish idealists occasionally ask a ridiculous question if we want more affordable housing why don t we simply build more affordable housing occasionally a developer foolishly idealistically approaches a city council with a proposal consisting of something like hey i can build modest housing for half the cost and the response translated from official city council legalese is essentially don t let the doorknob hit you on the way out the reason that modest and inexpensive homes will never be encouraged is that they threaten a paradigm of greed and the powers that be who gain the most from that paradigm excerpted from we re doomed a humorous exploration of humanity s war against life

1,the covid vaccine is gene therapy eli please h i can get away with this post today since it s casual friday i tried posting this question in r coronavirus amp just got downvoted not answered for background i only took a st year uni biology course meant for non science students so my understanding of genetics doesn t go much beyond mandel s experiments with plants the covid vaccine is gene therapy true or false and what does that actually mean in practice i ve seen this sentence attributed to hardcore antivaxxers amp it sounded ridiculous to me so i used it as an example of their beliefs in one of my own comments i was very surprised to get this response citing moderna s financial statements currently mrna is considered a gene therapy product by the fda unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell dna and could act as a source of side effects mrna based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell dna however side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mrna medicines despite the differences in mechanism the same poster also provided this link which didn t enlighten me much why does the fda consider these vaccines gene therapy why does moderna disagree can someone eli please
1,i used to think that we could engineer our way out of this what seems far more likely is that humanity will tear its self limb from limb once the vast majority have been exploited to virtual starvation the sheer amount of wealth inequality and masses of people ready to eat the rich is such a massive powder keg what happens when the economy tanks due to insolvency of insurance companies bought on by climate effects what of food insecurity due to crop failures dwindling water supplies the middle class has been eviscerated by the wealthy in western countries most live paycheck to paycheck france during the french revolution is a good example of what happens when people are starving lynch mobs amp guillotines organised humanity could overcome climate change i believe we won t be organised though the amount of division inequality and lack of support or wealth for the vast majority will result in society devouring its self once they are left to die the share anger towards the wealthy capitalism and the world it bought about will be too much for society to recover going to be brutal
1,cities in countries declared climate emergency justice democrats in congress the sunrise movement zero hour school strikers and extinction rebellion thoughts on what happens when desperation sets in when enough people get scared lots of people will still be in denial we ll see more polarisation over climate than even the devisons in politics we have now on the bau we ll have people with life plans kids schools careers looking after mom dad retirement hobbies holidays good standards of living nicely kept houses tidy gardens and good neighbours they have everything invested in believing the politicians and themselves are doing enough to think otherwise is to consider the doom of their children their parents and every plan that makes their lives meaningful you can imagine they will not change their perceptions even under great duress on the panicking side are the people with climate doom awareness who see the damage to the systems supporting the world s people who know just what is locked in and who know how much worse it can be if we carry on as we are for as long as it s physically possible there ll come a point when everyone on the  side will realise there s too many on the bau side to avoid total social  brought on by massive temperature changes total polarisation between two polar opposite tribes governments businesses and such will all be in the bau for reasons people have discussed at great length in the past this is what i think we ll see if we ever reach this impasse large and persistent attacks on power stations all over the world why they are key to everything that bau needs without power there s no manufacturing no industry no commercial nor residential activity schools don t open shops don t open consumerism ends supply generation ends ports fill with goods government offices can t process anything no office runs without computers and the electricity they need food stamps aren t processed chaos causes longer term damage to the social fabric of society riots fires anarchy the justification this is easy lifeboat ethics cause chaos and short term breakdown now many people die in the violence and lack of medical support tough love to show people survival is possible without massive consumption don t take action and bau causes enough pollution to ensure the climate won t stop changing until well past the point where a tiny fraction of the worlds population can survive kill to save the rather than let die due to bau watch for the attacks on the power grid it ll be the green new deal of the s

1,take down if necessary request to robert evans browser of r  and writer of it could happen here we all appreciate and love the work you do buton behalf of the stem community here we would all love it very much if you could have more individuals with stem backgrounds speak on the actual details and mechanisms of climate  for instance it would be beneficial for an audience to hear from a scientific communicator ideally with a back in physics or climate thermo dynamics on the actual implications and significance of each degree of heating i especially would love to hear further explanation about how once we pass degrees true almost exponential level run off takes place possibly put it in terms of how we as a species have always lived in glacial periods and about how once we reach run off we ll go to a technical tropical era a time so volatile and different from any world we re familiar with so much so that alligators lived at the north pole last time our planet experienced such a climate as it was one of the few land masses cool enough to live on
1,if you want to see why the free market sucks look at cars in europe of all cars sold are now suv s in the united states people are switching to these white trash vehicles too what will future generations think when they hear how we wasted our limited oil deposits on enormous cars like these they won t understand it in reality a free market system means that suv drivers have a perfectly rational motive to drive an suv if you sit in an suv you re safer during a collision a car driver is times more likely to die than an suv driver in a head on collision between the two does that mean driving an suv makes traffic safer no it doesn t because an suv is heavier and the car s weight is higher on the road the braking distance of an suv is longer which means that the driver is less able to avoid crashing into other commuters in addition the enormous size of an suv makes it more difficult for cars to see traffic signs traffic lights and other drivers thus suv s make traffic more dangerous but the suv driver is insulated from the harmful effects of his own vehicle choice as a result the presence of suv s in traffic creates a positive feedback loop by creating incentives for other people to drive an suv too in the ideal situation people would drive velomobiles which are probably the most energy efficient method of transportation out there but who s going to drive a velomobile when you have people in suv s out there look at the size of a velomobile compared to a regular car the velomobile is so small and the passenger is located so low on the road that he is easily overlooked by the suv driver people feel unsafe in a velomobile while people feel safe in an suv as a result the road is dominated by suv s rather than velomobiles an optimal solution would be one where every driver has the smallest vehicle that fulfills their need but to implement rules on this would lead every middle aged angry white male to ramble about big government socialist keynesian tyranny on the comment section of his favorite blog because god forbid we ever try to avoid a tragedy of the commons situation thus the free market where every joe sixpack makes his own choice ensures that we are stuck with the worst imaginable outcome
1,following the following i don t know i feel like there s something more here it s so bizarre i first was interested in this writing because he was talking about the seriousness of climate change then his blog posts turned to talking about suicide grief and coping with loss then i heard the recent interview on c realm with two people who went to age of limits in and said guy mcpherson and his followers made things really uncomfortable for everyone guy s message isn t designed for comfort it s convenient to dismiss his ideas and ridicule followers it s not a comfort when someone isn t vying for your commerce but nthe doesn t need your support in the words of thom yorke just cause you feel it doesn t mean it s there is that off color if grief is too much for you if is too soon for you there s several deep green movements that could use your commercial attention as they are actually doing something and therefor in need of financial support guy s message is all black no amount of capital or attention will change the supposed outcome there s power in that it s just not our power nature bats last the power is there

1,i m trying to determine a safe height for a coastal home i m thinking about purchasing a plot of land in a beachfront zone in uruguay south atlantic coast the first line of houses are almost at sea level and too expensive anyway but as you move maybe km inwards that s some to m above sea level i believe this is very safe especially since this area of south america usually is not marked as a risk zone in those maps about rising seas however the situation in bahamas was so scary that got me second guessing we do not have normally hurricanes in this area but nothing is normal these days so how much the sea can rise during such hurricanes what is the minimum height you would deem safe in this part of the world
1,global ecolocigal catastrophe climate catastrophe super sars pandemic and global economic  will lead to global societal  in year that will go down in history for centuries to come even one of these mentioned above in itself is able to induce societal  but four of them occuring at the same time on a global scale is truly rare cosmic event the showed the end of the world on tv and people started to panic and hoard goods just like many of us predicted on the sub year will go down in history for centuries to come as the year global societal  really began the world is not going to recover from this all countries will be overwhelmed and societies will be ripped apart this will lead to obliteration vast numbers of people across the entire world will die birth rates will plunge to levels that causes a dramatic population decline the complete breakdown of economic cultural and social institutions with further ecological consequences will follow the current world has exhausted its own design and will be unable to adapt recover bounce back or whatever some economists make you believe agree or disagree
1,humor schedule for the future of earth simpsons is all knowledge and hidden messages the internet has given us access to these resources and the masters have decided to release information through subtle means i think i also find it funny they would do it latest episode the simpsons go to antarctica significance none whatsoever unless your the paranoid card of the illuminati card game three things to take from this episode people will do anything for survival in a viral apocalypse even on cruise ships the premise of the episode the viral pathogen pandoravirus is a new type of virus that was uncovered and revived by french virologists satisfied enough no did you know that the reason why they had to uncover it is because it has been buried for years so whats the significance to size of genome that it s inversely correlated to mutation rate it has the largest genome out of all dna virus that s great until you need to change the virus for vaccine purposes when other methods surprisingly dont work and it all goes to shit i don t need to tell anyone about the significance of a virus being ancient it hasn t touched a living thing in k years what kind of messed up variations are we going to get of this so we go to a late chan post about a mason and his buddies sharing stories about the grand plans of our small world and antarctica s lost alien or predecessor civilization another fun part to this is that they said there was an entire timeline written on one of the structures walls says it predicts everything in strange drawings such as and other events hilarious except no one knew this guy on chan was verifiable until after the square based pyramids showed up on google maps its right next to the ancient riverbed if you zoom out you can see the erosion of the river and where the temple is located i ll let you investigate for yourself obviously this evidence would not be enough so i invite you to take a solo expedition to antarctica only to realize you can t go to of the continent would love to see other drawings but he also said that parts of the bible are missing that take out vital details and that its all true they were drinking at the time so it was probably more in a metaphorical sense proclaims that game of thrones is probably the closest representation of our world due to an impending apocalypse perpetuated by a virus that our lords will release hence pandoras box apparently we might uncover something in antarctica analogous to the army of the dead probably due to the drawings and the unmentioned third world workers who died exploring the ancient ruins of antarctica so what we do know antarctica will be a pinnacle of major discovery but also of the horrors to come if they do decide to release us the simpsons is abnormally good at predicting things it also it worthy to note that secret order illuminati probably has control over mainstream entertainment sources such as hollywood the simpsons could just be a side joke for us paranoids humans are an experiment gone awry fancy monkeys under control by extraterrestials or as the stories go the habitable super earth that is our current asteroid belt was blown to bits because i guess our species or another species got ridiculously aggressive huh sounds familiar and i guess the extraterrestials had to end it too much bad shit or it may have been vice versa supposedly the others might have not known about the ice age and all froze to death or they could be all sleeping waiting also the best part of the episode where the kids are all wearing badges that say elite it hurts my theory is that the good guys actually lost the bad guys took the reigns and are trying to penetrate the last stronghold of the good guys maybe for their secrets maybe for another war in another galaxy or solar system anyways your all talking about the weather and shit when the true enemy lies to the north

1,massive redefinition of employer worker relationship will take place as the precariats increase and most of the labor will be competed around the world employers will have all the rights and the workers nothing there will be no workers comp or anything like that practically all work except for the highest managerial will be done by contract workers for which there are no responsibility lose a limb too bad fall into the furnace well we will pay for the cost of funeral just for good measure these radical measures do reduce overhead increase the bottom line and help economy grow soon making a living will be just a series of gigs with constant stress it will be like the life of a no name actor or musician who does not know where the next gig may or many not arrive such environment won t be ideal for reproducing so a lot of people who are in this state of life won t reproduce thereby culling them from the gene pool without any violence that means only the few who can escape the circle of gigs the higher echelon of society will get to reproduce
1,could thunderstorm asthma be killer wet bulb conditions thunderstorm asthma is thought to be the complex interplay of a high heat thunderstorms lighting and pollen creating a deadly asthmatic triggering event what if this killer combo is actually the wet bulb temperature reaching dangerous levels and people with respiratory conditions being more prone to being effected killer wet bulb temperatures are a rare combination of high heat and high humidity this combination is deadly when it prevents people from sweating to cool down they heat up internally even if thunderstorm asthma is not the interplay of deadly wet bulb conditions could summer thunderstorms be the place where we are most likely to see a deadly combination of heat and humidity in the future

1,ecomodernism bright green ecology i posted an item here yesterday which i thought might prove contrary to the views of most here and more importantly would result in discussion of the weaknesses and strengths of the piece in question i was half right it s sunk like a stone what i m concerned about is the lack of discussion as a periodic reminder i don t post things simply because i agree with them some are meant for discussion the ecomodernist manifesto is a piece just published by members of what s apparently called bright green environmentalism an ideology i d just discovered yesterday as for why it s significant several of the members notably stewart brand are icons of the environmental and sustainability world or at least portions thereof they ve got a following a platform and some backing as well as the long now foundation meaning they do get occasional press attention which is to say sense or nonsense the arguments and assertions of this piece are likely to be ones you ll encounter periodically including from people who claim to be working for sustainability or an improved future with that in mind i d like to invite r  to take a second look at the piece and consider it critically dress it up or down as you prefer but do take a look i ve added a comment with a brief explanation for why i posted it i d meant to do so following my initial submission my apologies for not having had time to do so earlier

1,the crux of renewable energy here is a user translated part of an interview with jean marc jancovici who if you don t know him already is a kind off well known french consulting engineer and teacher in energy and climate the industrial revolution has consisted in abandoning renewable energies for fossil fuels if renewable energies were equal or superior to fossil energies there would have been no reason to switch from windmills to oil oil is extremely energy dense it is easy to transport and store behind it a few other energies are not far behind coal gas and nuclear power intermittent and diffuse energies wind and sun have been abandoned to build our civilization of controllable machines today wind turbines are inexpensive because we have fossil fuels and globalized chains their masts are made with coal their studs with cement made with gas inside there is copper made with coal all this is transported from the other side of the world with oil the low price of wind turbines and solar panels is based on fossil fuels when these fuels are no longer there at all the price of anything and everything will become much higher including wind and solar collection devices back in the world was renewable an all renewable world is the only one that our species has known between its appearance years ago and the beginning of the industrial revolution so there is no physical problem to go back to it what is not possible is to return to it with million inhabitants in europe and euros of gdp per person per year and paid pensions until the age of the industrial revolution is to have added to men thanks to fossil fuels the ever growing strength of an ever growing fleet of machines which process matter instead of our arms and legs and which now do everything in our place crops clothing housing roads and bridges transportation and the billion different products that can be found in the world continuing to power the same over powerful machinery with just renewable energies will not be possible a renewables world is therefore a world where the number of machines that can be added per person will be considerably smaller and the economic translation of the business is a much smaller gdp per person as well this is what politics has not understood or pretends not to understand it s hard to know a renewables world is a world where purchasing power has decreased a lot i m not saying that we shouldn t do it i m just saying that it s lying to promise it without a strong contraction of consumption

1,melting glaciers in italy greenland himalayas and the polar ice caps aren t the only places where glaciers are disappearing this is happening in the heart of europe i m not sure what kind of impact this will have on local water supplies or agriculture but i can t imagine it would be positive amp xb italy calls fast melting glacier in mont blanc range an alarm that can t be ignored milan a fast moving italian glacier is melting quickly threatening a picturesque valley near the alpine town of courmayeur and prompting the mayor to close down a mountain road mayor stefano miserocchi has forbidden access to a section of the val ferret outside of courmayeur a popular hiking area on the south side of the mont blanc massif or mountain range the precaution was taken after experts monitoring the massive planpincieux glacier said they are recording ice movements of up to almost inches a day they warned that an million cubic feet mass of the square mile glacier was at risk of collapsing there are no models to tell us if it will fall entirely or in pieces the mayor told sky tg we need to keep an eye on the monitoring the glacier is located in the alps on the grande jorasses peak of the mont blanc massif which straddles the borders of italy france and switzerland and contains the highest peak in western europe officials said unusually high temperatures during august and september had accelerated the ice melt of the planpincieux which has been monitored by the safe mountain foundation since italian premier giuseppe conte alerted world leaders to risk of the glacier s  during his address tuesday to the u n general assembly in new york city it is an alarm that we cannot be indifferent to he said a new special report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change said wednesday that glaciers around the world outside of greenland and antarctica but including europe are losing billion metric tons of ice a year the report said glacier melt is happening faster than before and is accelerating the report projects that if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these glaciers in general will shrink between now and the end of the century but smaller glaciers like those in the alps could lose up to of their ice by the year in a worst case scenario many glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emissions the new science report said matthias huss a glaciologist at eth zurich and head of the group glacier monitoring switzerland said the loss of glacier ice in switzerland and europe over the last five years has been the strongest since measurements began in the s he noted that the freezing line of degrees fahrenheit rose above the top of mont blanc this summer which very rarely has happened we have melting at an elevation of almost meters feet above sea level which is really changing the system and can support such events as glaciers falling down he said over the last years switzerland has lost of its glacier volume with nearly loss in alone huss said if this trend continues switzerland could lose all glaciers by the year if warming continues a change in policies could save the bigger ones he said but smaller ones will be lost regardless we hope climate prevention measures are implemented and the warming trend is slowing down huss said if we continue as we did then there is no rescue for the glaciers in the alps courmayeur was not affected by the mayor s order and no one has been evacuated courmayeur spokesman moreno vignolini said wednesday adding that the road that was closed is used mostly to access summer homes the mayor was meeting with residents and homeowners to hear their concerns some limited access was being granted for people who needed to check their property
1,could continuous pandemics actually help humanity let s say right after we start to finally get over coronavirus another pathogen hits us then another essentially forcing us to permanently restructure our systems also making it logistically impossible for modern industrial society to pollute the planet as much as we have in the past century we d be forced to simplify everything as the majority of businesses and companies deemed non essential would simply cease to exist granted this is an over simplification of a complex situation but could this actually save us or at the very least minimize how bad our future might be mother nature would essentially bring us to our knees and force us to cut out all the bullshit like it s basically doing right now we can all pretty much agree that a revolution happening this decade is wishful thinking to say the least maybe the earth will just have it s way with us interesting to think about seeing nature rebound like it has already is such a beautiful sight i m probably naive but curious to hear what you guys think
1,in which scenario can humanity become really extinct the human species is hard to believe to become extinct even in a scenario of hothouse earth that would result in a new cretaceous humans may survive in the poles north and south ones like it happen in the cretaceous with crocodiles in the poles so is humanity as a species really at stake by climate change
1,do you know what angers me the most about  in a bau scenario the fact that the wealthy the very people most responsible for  will post up in their walled enclaves with their last civilized technological bearable ways of live relatively conserved while the rest of us will be left out in the collapsing wilderness to fight over the leftovers they will likely carry the torch of humanity into the future and will most likely be the people most future humans are descended from they do not deserve to live through this any more than we do

1,you may not like barack obama you may not like ron paul however i think the time has come to the point where we as people have to put politics behind us for a moment perhaps we should take a moment to forget those in power focusing only on our own actions as a collective one thing is clear my fellow redditors especially those in america we are on the verge of total  financially there has to be some kind of defining moment where we can come together as a people and decide that we don t like the way the country is going it doesn t matter if you re libertarian republican democrat or communist the only way we are ever going to get our country back is to stop trying to arguing and trying to work each other over we need to come together and we need to revolt as peacefully as possible of course it starts with a few and will end with many is anyone interested in organizing some kind of peaceful march across the usa is anyone for organizing any kind of of peaceful protests in major us cities or camping in front of the white house gathering in city hall s in every city where are all the movements at we re literally falling apart at the seams and no one cares it s like everyone is stuck watching a pinwheel i m tired of standing by idle what can we do as a collective edit clarification
1,are there any papers regarding potential eco terrorism eco revenge acts since we already had cases though history of people committing terrorist acts for ecological reasons the unabomber in some sense was as he saw himself fighting against the industrial society and technology for example the only logical conclusion from what we read everyday in r worldnews and in r  is that at some point or another those driven to extreme situations by climate change will try to exact revenge upon those they see as supporters of companies activities that impacted on their life or they may just attack all of society as generalized backlash i tried searching for something serious or a large study but i couldn t find anything have you guys read something about this
1,how many women and kids do we have to kill we have blockaded yemen and syria we are starving women and children when we re not bombing the fuck out of them then we are told that clinton is the lesser of evils and looks more presidential the world is run by retards black lives don t matter not even olive skinned lives matter the women and children of sudan are fleeing starvation the women and children of nigeria are starving we don t give a fuck then some stupid idiot like derrick jensen tells us we gotta blow up the system sending your kids to jail while he obsesses over porn we are too fucking stupid to live
1,just a writing piece i wrote about our society and culture my letters an words have never been to the top of any perimid it is to the slaves of those people my letters have always been to the people that felt were forgotten and damned by those people not to the top of the republican party not to the top of the democratic party not the top of the nazi party or the top of the gang party those people have had their own agendas and own manipulations not to the top of the church not even to the people that surround them they have kissed enough ass and sold enough sweat that they are corrupt too you say there is no such thing as peace but theses people are only the top say layers down or or layers down its to the people that were told to hate and carry the guns its to the people who never had a chance to know why they are doing what they are beihg told to do the ones indicrmininmety cast aside and used and spied on and told what they are doing they evils and the war and the lies were for the greater good there are layers to a pyramid it can not stand without the base my letters where never to the celebrities busy playing there games and spuwing their bullshit not even to the people are them who have kissed enough ass to make themselves part of it not to the rappers and the fancy singers not to the poduceres and the directors not even to the people that surround them its to the men and women who they have forgotten have a voice the ones that have seen things but are not allowed to say what the ones that are tired of being used as fodder for their schemes to become rich and powerful three are more of us then them do you feel spied on do you feel like your political party is using you to advances an agenda you can t understand taking away your money and putting it in their already full banks it is the truth they are leaving us behind planning and shemeing to one day live without us are you drinking lead tainted water are you dealing with an oil spill did you feel as sick as i did when you found out already rich obama was speaking at confences for dollars and speech did you feel sick when you heard mitt romney call us the what was it or disposable leaches or killery clinton deny all allegations of her emails and husbands betrayl calling you deprolable fuck that cunt im deplorable to bitch to advance her own political carreer or how about when trump told the crowed he would pay for the abusive mans legal bills when he sucker pucnched the protestor right in the face are you a solder who feels scared to go kill people scared to come how to a wife with an already warm bed or worse yet to children that are years older and have learned to live without you only to find you don t have a job and can t function because of ptsd that the government has forgot you too that the health systems have forgot you too they asked me if prostituin was ok no they asked me if drugs were ok sure but you people have got us all hooked on opiates and heroin and don t give a shit then you make pot illegal while the one thing killing all us men and women is alkhol when you keep the border open so drugs from true born evil men and women from mexico slaughter and oppress our own neighbors then these people come to us for help and we leave them and damn them and demonize them as what did trump say rapists and murdrers fuck you trump and some i guess are ok no nearly all are ok and all are scared because of our appitiete for drugs and violence you people say peace is impossible but sorry peace is law it is law there is no choice peace is impossible while the leaders of your groups remain leaders but they can t live their dreams without their fodder it has always been our choice to put down our guns but americans in charge have made a business out of these tools they sell them to our enemies and friends then go and put your lives in hell so they can be used and make more how long is something around to prevent and control something else before it becomes dependent on the things it was trying to stop when is having a strong defence the worst terrorist organization in history its when they sell those weapons to other its when they no longer can t feed the prison system or else they will lose money and power it s the funcionilst perspective and trust me the people in power know this well it used to be they would keep their ears to the ground and see the shifts in american culture race relaions drug use socioeconomic desparities then the powerful would step into control it once they gainded the knowlenge to actually create these things and harness their created hate that they become evil know they created it then control it you nazis are being used by your hate you gang members are being used by your hate you church goers are being used by your fear if they say that it s ok that there is a better life after you die that it s ok if yousuffer and are sad and scared that you can spend your life praying to a plastic jesus for salvation and it will all be alighright after you die the enemy has your mind this is the only life we can prove we have this is our one shot we are not our fathers and mothers we are the ones that own this world get up stop using their drugs stop watching their violent manipulaions on television go get treatment for you addictions stop taking the drugs they prescribe unless you know it will help you start spending time with your kids and loving them start taking care of your business and your family stop lisening to people who say they have all the answers yes that includes this letter there should be no trust in anyone but yourselves and your family now the vestiges must crumble we must create chaos and watch the powerful limp around we must see where they limp to and destroy that as well we must vote although i no longer believe that counts for much its our only voice they say they don t want to pay taxes that you are only worth dollars and hour look into how much profit you company makes off your own back at apple the average workers sells thousands and makes dollars while apple just but away what billion overseas why do we have to give the companies a tax break when all the profit they make is sitting in a back somewhere on an island or invested in machines that will one day kill someone why do i have to pay for some rich cunt to fly around on a jet while i can t even put gas in my truck why was no banker prosecuted for the finalcnail  of that broke my father for years not just finically but emotionally as well do you know why no one was prosecuted because they are the ones still running our government they are the people who we should depend on to proscute so poor black fuck gets his life torn away in prison because he doesn t have the funds to feel safe so he steals and peddles drugs and acts hard they throw that person in prison to be raped and tortured and tuned into a monster while the people truly responsible run for office and start companies and merge banks and lie they got away with the biggerst heist in history now they just cover it up and move on its wrong you all are wrong i speak to the people times removed from all this the office drones the foot soldiers those are the ones that need to stand up now ps we have no business going to war with each other when the enemy controls our ranks it s time to go to war from within if they don t give us peace we must take it if they don t give us respect me must respect ourselves what they want is for us to keep fighting the battle lines they have drawn it our turn to turn that hate against them to fight within our own organizations to fight for truth justice peace is law breaking this code is punishable by death from your own ranks see if this doesn t happen

1,ranty questions for doomers or an existential  argument attempt i do not much fall in line with the average nihilist doomer but i cannot accept much of the current hopes either it is obvious that much of the damage is certainly irreparable and that almost all current theories attempts at solutions have unknown side effects that will almost certainly create even further complications maybe even a greater chaos than we currently find ourselves in as certain as our doom may be i must also reject those who advise simply enjoying what little time we have currently excessive hedonistic micropleasures fail and fall more and more shallow and i feel that as more shtf more people will slowly awaken to how impossible enjoying much of anything will be i feel my lifetime in the ivory tower has me hellbent on a love of suffering it is demented how desperately i wish to devote myself to suffering so as to find a way to transcend the mistakes of past generations i don t mean pointless unnecessary suffering if it is so necessary to have an identity i would like to assert an identify of anything that will contrast me to those who let greed and hedonistic desires consume them so entirely that they never questioned their place in history amp xb i see selfishness more specifically the obsession humans have with valuing themselves over others as a stain that reveals every step of human progress has ultimately been nothing more than prideful masturbation we must atone for these sins of greed and become what our ancestors were so sure was impossible genuinely selfless i cannot reason that our species has ever truly conceptualized honor or integrity because of this inability to acknowledge that all we ve sacrificed and gone through was for nothing thus far it is in this way i find suffering necessary and essentially meaningful not in the sense that it truly does atone for the wrongdoings but in that it builds a foundation or a framework from which we can clearly redefine what progress and success perhaps should have meant all along we cannot stop many of the destructive things in motion but we might be able to contain and control the damage better if we find a way to radically alter what we once called progress and maybe even redefine what it means to enjoy anything if the most critical ignorance of our ancestors was excessively enjoying what the world offered them to the point that it consumed both them and the planet itself is not the only moral path forward to radically rebel against everything they considered positive and readjust our moral compass accordingly i don t mean to just simply demonize hedonism i mean more specifically to glorify selflessness moderation and sustainability to a near religious level science has whittled most organized religion down to new levels of scarcity science caused a global influence so immense that the majority of the global population was forced to redefine what good and evil truly meant does the doom of our current ecological crisis not necessitate a similar mass influence in redefining what progress as a species truly means surely there can be a pivotal point where enough people can awaken to the deadend we are hurtling towards is it really so insane to expect the coming natural disasters to eventually shape humanity into correcting our path forward to some degree it feels like science slowly killed religion and crafted an unattached nihilistic universe but somewhere in the process of specifically evoking how uncaring the universe is science began to illustrate our certain imminent doom as a result could it not be argued that science is in a way crafting its own religious path forward meaning we should almost seek to worship the god of sustainability and selflessness if we wish to survive science proved our lives are meaningless but somehow most paradoxically it has even further proven a necessary purpose for us we must religiously rebel against our own nature to survive thusly science has essentially embedded our lives with the most unified purpose in all of human history the universe may not have a grand purpose or meaning but unavoidable extinction necessitates a new definition of purpose we thought meaning was more important than existence itself but with the end of the human journey in sight maybe existing itself is meaning the answer to why we should be anything has been realized as the same answer as to why we should mean anything that is to say do you really need a reason to exist a purpose if your very existence your very ability to pursue a purpose gets called into question existence is an implied meaning in itself once we truly realize that we cannot be allowed to stay here we no longer need to burden ourselves with why we re here i don t mean that existence implies meaning because of a circular logic that we should exist to further our existence and from here meaning is birthed i mean we ve been given a purpose outside of ourselves by being born into a reality that is doomed the confusion arises when we believe we should attempt to create our own purpose we did not birth ourselves into existence external forces determined your being brought into the world so to have external forces of the ecological crisis radically determined our purpose i hope i m not just getting lost in my words here amp xb tldr has any philosopher tried to use  theory to argue that purpose and existence cannot be separated
1,i have gotten the moderna vaccine i can t help feel however being versed and reading frequently on environmental climate energy and sociopolitical  subjects like there isn t much point i have gotten the moderna vaccine about a week or two ago at a local target i can t help feel however being versed and reading frequently on environmental climate energy and sociopolitical  subjects like there isn t much point abrupt anthropogenic warming continues at a breakneck pace the severity and extremity being clearly demonstrated to us in record breaking heatwaves in the pacific northwest canada and pakistan the fires in british columbia fires in turkey the ongoing mega drought in the southwest with lake meade falling to dangerous lows the recent flooding disaster in germany famine in madagascar and other countless examples all the while deforestation rates soared and reached a new record high this month in the brazilian amazon under bungling far right president jair bolsonaro and his corporate big agribusiness cow farmer backers a new report showing parts of the forest have crossed the tipping point of transitioning to net source of c emissions rather than a carbon sink helping to sequester and offset some human caused damages the extreme weather is no surprise given the arctic sea ice melt and retreat rapidly warming times faster than the rest of the planet arctic amplification the decreasing temperature differences between the polar northern hemisphere and the tropics destabilizing the jet streams making them more wavy and slowed or becoming stuck in place longer over the land i do not anticipate the industrial developed nations such as the u s european union australia russia saudi arabia and china precipitously and immediately lowering greenhouse gas pollution and staying in line with ipcc targets of remaining well below c above the baseline never mind that we re over that already using the original baseline as if that s even a possible scenario at this late stage given multiple positive reinforcing feedbacks in the climate system being triggered and spiraling out of our hands such as the thawing of permafrost in siberia unleashing billions of tons of stored carbon methane and melting frozen methane hydrates from shallow arctic seas there are ancient unstudied viruses frozen in the permafrost as well waiting to be re awakened nobody in governments or corporate boardrooms will dare question constant debt financed economic growth the back to normal business as usual ideology of parasitic neoliberal capitalism which requires more and more accelerated burning trashing and depleting of the earth and finite non renewable natural resources is there really any realistic hope for us when a female catholic activist is sentenced to years in prison for damaging a pipeline or when the masses rush to hoard gasoline like a pre cursor to mad max when there s a hack that doesn t even directly impact the flow and delivery of oil governments want to please their consumer base with pollyanna promises and reassurances to shield them from a bleak reality of less available resources disruption of supply chains and lower energy return on investment eroi leading to lower standards of living i postulate this is one of the intractable flaws of democracy in action the same stuff plato wrote about thousands of years ago i guess and with the human population still growing in places like sub saharan africa and the middle east that are to become the epicenters of climate induced unlivable conditions marked by drought crop failures and commonplace lethal wet bulb temperatures the massive migration waves and civil conflicts will bring unparalleled horrors the wars in syria and yemen being driven or initiated by prolonged drought fresh water issues themselves a minor snapshot of the future deterioration of nation states if the number of humans continues to surge unabated with much of the projected further growth of an additional billion by coming from africa and asia the few slivers of wild non domesticated vertebrate animals hanging on only making up of the animal biomass today will be hunted poached and exploited into extinction and their corpses thrown in the stewpots with no help at all from the carbon methane and nitrous oxide emissions of the major contributors in the oil guzzling global north insects and critical pollinators like bees will plummet accordingly not that america is safe and our abundance of military grade firearms won t make our social fabric s slow deterioration much less of bloodbath as the third world you could even argue it will be worse given our unpreparedness privilege and the prominent psychology of unfettered competitive individualism and quasi social darwinism long story short there is no reason for optimism and gleeful celebration i m simply sick of pretending everything is fine and dandy if we just get our vaccines and overcome covid

1,thoughts after reading hot earth dreams by frank landis some of this are things he says in the book some are my ideas after reading his the luxury of global climate cooperation in an emergency nobody has long term thinking endless small disasters mean less time thinking about energy alternatives ironically the worse it gets the more people will rely on fossil fuels in disasters the focus is on local survival our global conversation about climate change and global cooperation is brought to you by fossil fuels at what point do things get so bad that localities let alone countries basically disregard all international agreements because nothing is enforceable and they have too much trouble on their hands as it is when oil disappears the world gets very small not even regional or local but micro local i don t know how i would get to the other side of my city without significant effort travel and transportation including the destruction of ports will make multi source manufacturing prohibitive what people will worry about know about will be incredibly localized either learn how to do what you did before using local resources or do without loss of knowledge anything on computers including the internet will be lost and become irrelevant and irretrievable within a century but even if you tried to print off or somehow retain the important stuff it would likely become irrelevant or mere hearsay in the future anyway without the context of everything else scientific knowledge and discoveries without a global scientific community will become religious dogmas then myths then forgotten the most recent discoveries using advanced technology likely won t be rediscovered for millions of years if ever i think what i will really miss from civilization will be the loss of intellectual culture which is based on lots of leisure time when of humans are focused on agriculture again that makes me sad but it was basically how my great great grandparents lived i got to play at being aristocracy during my lifetime due to living at the height of a fossil fuel civilization but that will likely not be possible for my kids grandkids or anyone after me random thoughts the loss of ubiquitous air conditioning will make daily life feel very different modern concrete is only made to last years there will be few ruins of our society it will simply disintegrate into nothing centuries from now will anyone know we went to the moon especially when all the space centers are underwater will we have to wait until the next fossil fuel civilization for that to be attempted again equality for women has been based on a series of very recent technological changes when these things disappear what will happen to women low density living more freedom from society more dependence on family and neighbors high density living independence from neighbors and family less freedom from society

1,there will be no financial crisis the have nothing to worry what is important gt interest rates exports foreign consumption consumer spending profits amp earnings and technological innovation what is not important gt labor sentiment student loans and healthcare spending that s right even if there are huge unemployment students are crushed by student debts and sick just die the economy does not hurt it is a non event what is happening is the eternal separation of the richer and smarter pop and the rest once for all the poorer people will be dealt brutally by repression while the worthy will reside comfortably in their well protected castles with no need to be concerned by the flight of the poorer souls the one thing which might end the whole show is resource shortage something this guy and many other optimists ignore at  i am arguing that something has to be done before resources run out but being optimists they are ignoring it but today s financial system is so strong and so robust that the rest of the people will not able to even dent it and will have to accept their penury suffering and pain it is evolution at work and nothing can stop it except the shortage of resources
1,paradise lost hello everyone i m a bit frustrated with the widespread head in the sand syndrome i find in general i m all for positive solutions but i also think for them to have an impact we need to face reality and promote expediency there is something about this phenomenon that is so akin to the legend of the native americans who failed to see columbus s ships when they passed by presumably because huge ships were so alien to their experience that their perceptions could not register what was happening and they literally failed to see the ships please read here please read the article some of the graphs are enlightening let me know you thoughts thank you
1,typical chat window in overshoot times user yeah i totally see that i think there are a lot of people who are unconscious winners too they just never thought about it happy eating slice after slice of cake and then thinking they could make the cake infinitely bigger user that s the galling thing right that this wicked problem is just made from so much blithe unconsciousness we belong to a cultural segment of the whole that places the intellect on a throne and we try to live that way if there is a problem i can solve it if i m responsible i ll pay for it etc unfortunately our continual optimization of our environment enables to live in unconscious consumption for every who embraces responsibility and introspection who among our tribe was the first to feel so insecure he had to actually implement his vast productivity improvements wicked was he though we call him hero a jot more wisdom would have told him to sit still and let the turning of phosphorous into food remain as a pleasant dream user your build is done user okay thanks
1,looking for perspective on prepping how us centric is this mentality i was breezing through a couple articles on the r today and came across a comment about how focused so much of the articles and guides are for a us environment focused on guns assuming large areas of the country to cover for bugging out etc prepping is hitting a little bit of the mainstream these days with shows like doomsday preppers and doomsday bunkers what is prepping like in the uk or other western european countries what permutations do those regions focus on what s the thoughts on limited access to firearms in those situations
1,just another  rant i m at the point where i feel like that video where the guy looks at a shop and sees nothing but the word consume on every product and sign and obey on the uniforms of anyone with a badge and of people are wearing glasses that keep them from seeing what s real the glasses are our education indoctrination deeply embedded so we don t think anything is wrong when in reality we re just more livestock for the of humans who control the global food supply and use media to brainwash the slaves into being happy about it all i want is to feel connected to spirit connected to community and connected to nature the west has come with a severe case of racial amnesia like our species has forgotten their roots of small communities of close friends and families now we re all overworked overstressed and forced to live within a monetary and class system we didn t choose that has been designed by millionaires for millionaires and now they re all billionaires while the average persons value has been slowly diminished to a point of glorified slavery over the last years we get very little choice in anything they just make us think we have options but in reality this is an open air prison where you need to make money so you can afford to consume shitty quality products that continuously drop further in quality as corporations work to increase profit margins by outsourcing jobs to literal slaves in third world countries using the lowest grade cheapest materials available this place sucks and the humans all about this lifestyle are fucking psychopaths to me there s no way out though because this is our only planet and almost everywhere is obsessed with this money shit even if you go deep into the woods and cut yourself out of society as a whole the inspectors will eventually be at your doorstep to collect fees for not following proper procedure and from then on you ll have to pay for property tax because we never really own anything we rent government owned spaces from the banks and as soon as we stop giving them money it isn t ours anymore i hate the world humans have created it could have been beautiful we could have been caretakers of this planet instead we ve all but damned this world to thousands of years of turmoil and thousands more years of recuperation all because we can t learn how to properly manage earths resources and live with nature instead of against it like what happens when the cities start running out of water we ve seen it small scale in places like flint and a good amount of california but we re about to see droughts and food shortages in unprecedented numbers people are gonna die by the millions if not by the billions when this shit finally hits the fan we re already projected to lose roughly a million people every year after due to lack of food and water access people are gonna kill each other for food people kill each other on black friday to save on a tv now replace that tv with the last few pounds of meat in an entire city and tell me you don t imagine a war zone breaking out now replace that city with a whole country chaos civil war famine drought extreme fires exponentially worsening natural disasters shits about to get serious and it s too late to find refuge in nature sadly nature as we know it won t survive this either years from now this world is gonna resemble mars more than earth and we ll probably be living in eco domes sorry i m so pessimistic i just can t see it going another way anymore how does everyone cope with this shit most days i just want to die can t even leave the house without getting stoned first to numb these anxious and depressing thoughts can t even look people in the eyes anymore because i feel like i can t hide the distress in my own eyes can t talk about my views because people are too ignorant of what s actually happening to comprehend the shit i m saying so i stifle myself now how can people just ignore what s happening in the world why can t people see how serious this is i hear the word alarmism and get called an alarmist and it s like yeah i m fucking freaked out of course i m going to raise the alarm when the entire scientific community is doing the same fuck sorry about the rant guys idk what to do with myself i need therapy but all the ones near me are christian faith based therapists and i already have enough bullshit to deal with some judgemental asshole trying to tell me some faceless god i ll never know as real is gonna save me unless of course i break a rule then i m gonna be fucked by satan with a flaming hot spear for eternity sounds like someone with a mental problem trying to help other people by replacing their mental problems with the accepted mental problem sorry again
1,meta new subreddit rules hi folks reddit has introduced a new feature subreddit rules these are general posting and behavior guidelines that are formalized in a rules page attached to the subreddit aside from the utility of providing more formal posting guidelines these rules can also be used by people reporting posts and moderators can associate bans with specific rules the rules page hasn t been linked to yet as we wanted to post the draft rules for community feedback at this time reddit only supports up to ten rules so keep that in mind when making suggestions rules posts must be relevant to the process of overall societal  please avoid links to things that can be considered minor symptoms of systemic  example while things like a bridge failure might be related to underfunding of capital infrastructure and that a symptom of  bridge failures also occur in societies that aren t collapsing an article that identifies a significant rise in infrastructure failures on the other hand would be relevant see the faq for further details no prepper or survivalist posts such posts belong in other subreddits devoted to that subject no product reviews or recommendations no conspiracy theories or posting of provably false misleading information it s possible to speculate on literally thousands of conspiracy theories but without solid evidence of such those discussions are a waste of almost everyone s time no duplication of posts this includes reposting of articles on alternative websites in cases where two of the same article are posted the one that was posted last will be removed no racist material racist posts and comments will be removed by the moderators and warning given to the poster posts to videos or podcasts must have a title that clearly indicates their contents moderators must be able to determine if media posts are relevant to the subreddit without having to watch or listen to the whole thing posts with insufficiently descriptive titles will be removed no trolling abusive behavior while in general commentary is not subject to the same restrictions as posting and angry discussion is expected and tolerated discussion that gets out of hand may require moderators to step in repeated incidents by specific users may result in a temporary or permanent ban thank you we now return you to your previously scheduled

1,icymi robert evans wrote a sequel to it could happen here set decades later in titled after the revolution follow the story of three different characters in a shattered texas as the heavenly kingdom sweeps into power i ve listened to it could happen here last year when the george floyd protests started and when this subreddit was talking about this podcast and civil war posts were abundant i quite enjoyed it could happen here thanks for the recommend and i am quite pleased that robert evans wrote and is currently releasing a fictional novel set several decades after the events of the second american civil war currently listening to it now and it is quite a treat after the revolution direct link follows the story of three inhabitants of the republic of texas a failing libertarian rump state in manny is a fixer ferrying journalists from overseas across the hotspots of north texas sasha is a suburban teenage girl in the american federation seeking to join the dominionists and roland is an old us army war veteran with a head full of broken memories the heavenly kingdom a religious extremist militia with a burning cross suddenly sweeps into power and we experience the nightmare of the flames of damnation through the eyes of our three protagonists in my opinion the audio podcast version is the best way to experience this novel as they managed to work in ambient environmental audio that really sets up the scene hope i m not violating any rules i m pretty sure some of you would appreciate the media recommend
1,if we wanted to make physical change what would be the most impact we could assist with to help curb the destruction of society planting trees i know things look bleak but i m also a believer that movements can help if we arm the average person with what we know is there a specific tree that would do well in this coming climate that we could begin to plant what would be the most optimal trees plants to use

1,preparing for the future hi all i don t usually come here as i don t find the doom and gloom helpful however accurate it may or may not be but i figure as you re all thinking about this stuff you may be able to help out my dream is to have some kind of a homestead one day in the uk where i live we ve had some nutty weather over the past few years and it s got me thinking about how to prepare for the future i m nowhere near buying land or a house yet as i m fresh out of uni but it s something i m thinking about and saving for my parents live somewhere that is already battered by wind and close ish to the coast which i m guessing is far from ideal so what should i consider when looking for a place to live are there any ideal areas of the uk that may not be hit as hard by the ecological amp climate  or is it simply too unpredictable are there any practical techniques or concepts to disaster proof a future home are there any resources or guides on how the uk s climate is likely to shift and what crops may succeed in the future would love to discuss and get some feedback
1,market crash strategy cash bitcoin land deflation vs inflation been researching the best methods to navigate and profit from a potential market crash i ve found many varied opinions and contradictory information it seems buying gold and silver are probably the safest options for wealth preservation but i would like to buy discounted assets during the downturn which requires being liquid and nimble a few things im unsure about there is a debate as to whether deflation or inflation will occur i believe there will be deflation then inflation and i assume it will only be a matter of months from a massive crash in value credit shortage and therefore deflation followed by a flood of cash from the central banks and inflation which leaves a relatively small window of time to use the cash to buy discounted assets is this true which is the best currency to hold during this period and how do you take advantage of this window james rickards believes there will be a bank lockdown and people wont have access to cash like cyprus he says this could extend for months would there be any offshore banks that would not close access to account holders and if so which banks he is also very negative on bitcoin but if banks close down wont people start looking for alternative currencies like bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies out of desperation the public already loves bitcoin and hates bankers fiat currency so wouldn t it be the perfect time to own bitcoin how will real estate specifically land react during a crash or correction does it depend on whether its land or housing which land would do the best and in which country some say there is a massive real estate bubble and it will go down dramatically while others suggest its a hard asset providing insulation from a crash so would it be wise to hold onto cash and wait to buy during a crash or buy beforehand
1,dangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world source the washington post gt the mysterious blob covers square miles of ocean an area nearly twice as big as this small country and it has been heating up extremely rapidly by over degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit over the past century double the global average at its center it s grown even hotter warming by as much as degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit according to one analysis gt gt the entire global ocean is warming but some parts are changing much faster than others and the hot spot off uruguay is one of the fastest it was first identified by scientists in but it is still poorly understood and has received virtually no public attention

1,how much is the r  community prepping getting a level headed and rational realistic answer to this question given the current state of the world over at r preppers is impossible not to mention most of them are not nearly as knowledgable about coronavirus or  like we are here i trust this community a lot more to be less biased and more grounded in reality how much energy time and resources are you guys putting into prepping what are you focusing on at what point do those efforts become diminishing returns
1,cryptocurrency is revolutionary and everyone should own some let me explain cryptocurrency insulates the owner from national currency hyperinflation like we are seeing in venezuela one ether is worth the same in china in germany in america in bolivia in japan in australia the only other asset that the same can be said about are precious metals cryptocurrency is unique it is easier to transport than precious metals as it lives on the internet no one knows you own cryptocurrency cryptocurrency is a supranational currency gold can be stolen paper money can be deemed worthless internationally through hyperinflation cryptocurrency can be used anywhere cryptocurrency can cross international barriers cryptocurrency is revolutionary and everyone should own some do your own research into it

1,civilization can be extended for quite a long time by systematic culling rome might have fallen to the vandals in ce but long before that the center of everything had been moved to mediolanum which the americans call as milan and then to constantinople whom the turks call as istanbul which lasted for more years the empire shed its unprofitable areas and downsized to continue civilization right now whether some people like or not they generate little economic value and those who count values will not count them resources are running out some people think they are actually improving but i am very aware of the coming resource shortage what will probably happen is the elites will literally price out the future for those who can t pay most of us are alive because the elites have not gotten to eliminate their eyesores for whatever reason but all these problems in say inner city can be solved within a few months if they feel like it in a way which will not be liked by the denizens of these zones it is hard to argue with the premise that time has run out for most people around the world there is no way to maintain a first world lifestyle for everyone and the world needs enormous amount of resources to drive civilization forward not to feed etc a few billion people who are not likely to add much more to civilization in an economic intellectual or other ways the game can be continued for quite a long time by doing that in a utilitarian way sacrifices have to be made and it would be too much of a waste to sacrifice those who are most likely to develop a new civilization to conquer the space bau will continue for quite a long time with ordinary people well off enough to post in bulletin boards hardly noticing if someone understands how the game is played he she will understand what i say although will never admit it the shots are called by the elites especially the cognitive elites and the rest will have not much to say or do against their moves
1,how likely is it that this whole situation with the coronavirus gets much worse and lasts much longer the delta variant seems to be spreading despite vaccination and even if the vaccination helps prevent the worst symptoms it looks like transmission alone will increase mutation this of course raises the possibility that a new strain will develop which isn t stopped at all by the vaccine the new strain may also be more deadly so where does this end how can a variant of this coronavirus like this be stopped if one is at all active anywhere with as contagious as this coronavirus seems won t it constantly pop back up if it s not somehow stopped completely originally we didn t think this would be as deadly as the flu but if it is more persistent and continues to mutate could it end up being more deadly it doesn t help that many people especially in the united states seem opposed to even the most basic preventative measures to stop the spread how many people are going to end up dead because of this pandemic how much more economic harm is it going to cause are there any positives or any lights at the end of any tunnels

1,if you uncomfortably laugh off something that hurts you or from someone taking advantage your wife sleeps with your friend you re talking to your wife later her yeah we slept together he s a much better fuck you uncomfortably laugh and say i wish you two would have told me something first this is awful like so if you find yourself laughing uncomfortably at far less awful situations where you come out last you really need to tap into some new areas of your thoughts and feelings i m not on about a swashbukling ah you got me it ll be your last kind of comfortable laugh at an equal beating you i m on about the they totally took advantage of me lt uncomfortable laugh gt the laugh that s supposed to be exactly like the swashbuckling laugh but it s not it s a powerless persons attempt at brushing off the seriousness of the situation and avoiding engaging in it getting mad if you find yourself making one of these laughs stop you ve learned to be helpless like the elephant with the chained leg growing up the chain is un anchored yet the elephant won t move you re an adult now you have wants and needs and influence the adult you is not anchored to old authority figures respect your elders but you see that chain of the younger you and you are helpless you may get through life semi happily like that now but you won t when tshtf laughing uncomfortably and saying to your starving wife and kids i guess they were just faster than me won t put food in their bellies you see the problem with a sudden  situation and your way of handling the world start now start early before the  don t be an asshole and go on a raping and pillaging and thieving mission as if you ever would but if you feel that uncomfortable laugh get angry get irritated use those emotions as a motivation to influence the situation not to aim to win at the start you re just trying to learn that you can move your foot with the chain on it you do have influence even if it s bitching about a situation not whining why does this always happen to me that s a whine this situation sucks your behaviour right now sucks and i m annoyed at it things need to change is not a whine it s not whining to call out people and demand some form of constructive talk whining is ineffective complaints to a higher authority that doesn t exist about situations that you make no attempt to improve you re aim to stop those uncomfortable laughs and learn a different behaviour one more influential that will put your wants and needs on the stage it ll take years hence starting today when tshtf you won t be laughing off coming last in the queue for food you ll be one of all the others reaching for the back of that truck if  doesn t happen in our life times you ll be in a much better mindset to guide your own future good luck
1,the us yield curve just inverted buckle your seat belts while maybe this is not as indicative of total  but it is a sign of a coming recession i work in the financial sector and when i saw the news about this in the morning i probably got more spooked than any global warming news or environmental news thus far let me tell you why right now companies consumers and countries are in record amounts of debt interest rates are still super low despite recent increases a recession now would be a complete disaster the last big recession was stopped with bailouts and the slashing of interest rates this time around no one has any free cash for a bailout and interest rates can t go much lower central banks won t be able to control the slide this time around there is a very real chance of an economic depression not seen since the s that would be a disaster for the planet investment in green tech would slow down companies would resort to cheaper and dirtier methods of energy production mineral extraction and governments would relax regulations to help stimulate the economy while the carbon footprint for each individual might go down because people simply won t be able to afford to consume it will probably increase overall add in the fact that one of the best ways to emerge from an economic depression is a war and you have a perfect storm of  brewing obviously this is just my prediction based on one indicator but i think this recent development in the bond market is just another sign that things are going to start getting rocky we don t have a heck of a lot of margin for error any more and we keep pushing and pushing i m sure people will be able to counter a lot of my wild claims and i am open to discussion

1,this sub isn t good for your mental health if you stick around for more than ten minutes at this point i m going to have to call it quits if the doom articles get any more prevalent it should be better than this we seek to deepen our understanding of  while providing mutual support not to document every detail of our demise it s in the very description of our sub and yet the sub is littered with reposted articles of tired news with pointed headlines like how climate change is ushering in a new pandemic era this can t go on this sub is worse than toothless joe with his carboard sarape ornamented with the end is near bold text plastered all over it wallowing in self pity i believe we should focus on increasing our survivability and supporting each other since it s very easy to wallow in our own self pity examples of this include learning how to support the community and bring it together how to protect yourself your food and your possessions safely learning history through past revolutions and revolutionaries and how to recognise the signs of impending conflict there are such posts but are buried by fear mongering accidentally promoted by redditors like you and i without this the sub is no better than r worldnews and contributes nothing the good of it s users only causing despair and hopelessness yes eyes should be opened about  and it s great more people are  aware but open eyes are useless without a body to act with if you re going to do something about it it s my opinion that quality should be maintained and moderation should be enforced to more effect to quell the onslaught of doom articles and the like and prune the sub for a better standard going forward apologies for the half rant just something i had to get off my chest feel free to post your thoughts and possible solutions but in my opinion this sub is not sustainable in its current state
1,if society s how quickly would wild game and fish be rendered locally extinct by unrestricted hunting and fishing by everyone trying to about starvation of course urban areas would be screwed but even in rural areas how long would wild game and fish be available when everyone and their brother will be hunting and fishing with no more limits restrictions everyone will be trying to avoid starvation so nobody will care about hunting or fishing licenses or regulations for limiting how many deer or fish you can take home i guess you could argue that people would start murdering eachother over hunting and fishing spots but even so with so much uncertainty and fear even the handful of families who might band together to protect hunting and fishing areas would basically make all edible animals extict rapidly so what s your guess what would that timeline look like

1,does anyone else think this was all meant to happen humans work on human timescales and the planet doesn t given a thousand million simulations of this planet what percentage of those scenarios would have resulted in the inhabitants of this planet getting things right on the first try never have we wielded this much power or this kind of population it seems to me the best way to learn is from failure we ll fail and try again under much different circumstances but i don t think it does any good to cry about it when our current and future circumstances may have been a forgone conclusion considering we the most adaptable and successful apex predators were born on a planet with oil and other non renewable resources to take advantage of yet living on timelines that can t possibly comprehend the consequences of our actions until we reach critical mass interested to hear if you think there was any a realistic chance for us to avoid this i guess i feel like humans on this planet are the equivalent of adolescents we will do the most ignorant self destructive things despite evidence and logic but in the end we just have to make our own mistakes
1,renewable hyperbole it never fucking ends it s coming they re back i saw a news article today saying that china is build wind turbines every nano seconds now hold on that s obviously hyperbole you say but that s nothing compared to the articles that will soon appear on your favorite green websites proclaiming that china is leading the way with renewable energy they ll leave out the fact that china is also going to build nuclear plants by or that china builds enough highways each year to cross the u s twice over or that china used more cement in years than the u s ever has in its whole history or that china makes more steel each year than the rest of the world combined none of that will matter when grist think progress climate central write up their pro renewable china stories it s no different here los angles is running out of water and california is at the beginning of a multi century drought so to make the sun god happy they are going to sacrifice billions of dollars to build up solar energy in a desert many ignorant readers will say well they can desalinate water please forgive them they just don t know any better dubai can desalinate water because they are a rich oil kingdom america is not north america has more oil than it can safely burn but we can t afford to get it out we live in a world of total fantasy people think we are going to be dancing with unicorns and faeries while little black kids mine the cobalt our electric cars will need in the open mining pits of the congo people think we can starve the women and children of yemen while we swipe our dreams away on tinder they think we can use cluster bombs and phosphorous ammunition on women and children while plant our urban gardens to save the earth the reason i know about hyperbole is that my dad was irish he was born on st patrick s day and couldn t tell the truth to save his life he loved to bullshit excuse me i meant to say embellish i can no more change the minds of these people than they can change the minds of climate deniers and for this single reason alone we will all 
1,so what can the average person do discussion so apart from getting more worried and waiting for world governments to do something to make a massive impact on consumerism and big corporations which seems too intense and expensive for them to ever do what are some realistic steps we can do as concerned earth dwellers i m not a scientist or politician so i need to crowdsource some info on this one if everyone on this sub moved onto clean energy despite the increase in cost would that help increase the science funding in that area if we start returning shampoo bottles washing up liquid fabric wash e g all those plastic time containers to supermarkets can it go back to the producers to refill rather than make new ones is this a realistic demand give people money off for returning them can easily drop them off the next time you went shopping so isn t even a hard ask for the average joe generally horrified with all ways periods are handled every sanitary towel i ve ever used is going to live longer than me wet wipes as well are hidden plastic what do we need for camping now a spray bottle of water and a rag what kind of better alternatives are there to cut down the use of staple plastics we now rely on local farmers butchers carpenters skills need to come back i m excited for when you can t just buy a heap of plastic crap which entertains for minutes but like gorgeous wooden doll house because instead of competing with mass produced cheap stuff real people can actually have more creative jobs than sitting at a desk is there a way to encourage this are people here already learning new skills i m going to start growing my own food next spring or at least try st world need to help rd world get to our quality of living in a non harmful way it seems brazil is intent on getting rid of the rain forest can t we try and set up africa south america as massive solar power plants and buy energy from them countries should be sorting infrastructure out full stop imo uk needs to unprivatise trains and nhs i don t see how some people are so rich when something we hold dear as a country is dying for being underfunded and understaffed it s awful realising we re in a new fuedal era of big money wrapped as democracy in short if the government s are going to sit on their arses and discuss it til the cows come home well i want to feel like there are options for us all to start taking now or ideas to be shared be better going to government with a better plan then tell us the truth commit to less carbon by a date productive mass action people

1,no storm on florence s atlantic track has ever hit the us east coast until now no hurricane has ever been on the track in the atlantic followed by florence and subsequently made landfall in the us the reason florence is now very likely to do so is because abnormally now normal warm waters in the mid atlantic have created a large steering ridge of high pressure to standard deviations above normal this is pushing the storm west essentially it has nowhere else to go a very interesting development in terms of climate and weather and not one i ve seen discussed before

1,is suicide the only option michael ruppert was haunted by thoughts of  through his entire life towards his end he became of a proponent of near term extinction guy mcpherson s brand of fatalism that has drawn many followers in apocalypse man it was clear that ruppert was a broken defeated man yet he seemed to be finding spirituality and acceptance in his darkest of days things were looking as up as you could call anything in this world for michael and then he shot himself the conclusion i drew from that was that no amount of spirituality or meditation can bring acceptance of the death of the entirety of human culture and life on this planet whether you ascribe to near term extinction or you don t there are many reasons for and against the concept there is clear evidence that sometime in the lives of today s young people will experience violence destruction of the biosphere and unimaginable pain and suffering you me and everyone we love will be killed by war famine etc if not by the dangers of modern life then since it seems one can not prepare for death without constant thoughts of the end but the pressure of the worlds issue is going to be ever present anyways is the cessation of life the only way to escape the pressures from both sides this is only a philosophical cry for help my lack of belief in the afterlife leads me survive because it is all i have

1,human nature and psychopaths human nature is a complicated topic there are three main parties one that says humans are naturally evil and vice versa as well as a group which suggests we are neutral let s suppose that most average humans are at worst apathetic and at best engaging towards the impending climate catastrophe while they will produce a noticable effect in the global north on average normal neurotypicals are likely to not contribute much to climate change additionally it is an observation of mine that the average neurotypical isn t doing climate wrecking actions on purpose meaning during the possession of information about the adverse effects of their actions they do their best to decrease said actions though i may be wrong so in this hypothetical we have a majority group who doesn t contribute much to climate change and is at worst apathetic about it that raises the question is there any opposing group that knew about climate change well and purposely exacerbated it if my memory is correct exxon mobil had knowledge of the adverse effects of their actions since the s and s politicians had a good insight as well this is obviously due to the profit motive and keeping things normal however one must ask if this group of people exhibit different behaviors to the neurotypical are they a different kind of human indeed many of them are psychopaths and sociopaths it is an open secret that their traits are glorified in executive workplaces in addition to the traits of the narcissist one may argue weren t those people once normal corporate culture and leadership in general selects for psychopaths and similar types of humans it is likely that the higher ups today were always psychopaths but merely lacked the power to express it until now it is also worrying that these sorts of people create propaganda to lure neurotypicals on thinking that psychopathic actions are empathetic actions leading to a deluded populous it is no joking matter that celebrities and news anchors tend to exhibit certain behavior patterns that strongly suggest that they are not neurotypical so my question is this if we somehow got rid of psychopaths sociopaths and narcissists from the public sphere would we have a slim chance at overcoming the climate catastrophe keep in mind this is under the condition that the average neurotypical is between engaging and apathetic regarding climate change

1,filmmaker josh fox responds to michael moore s planet of the humans on bombshell climate film the link to the interview moore states that after decades of not winning the battle on climate change we need a new discussion on what we need to do krystal states that one of the central messages of the film is renewable energy is not the panacea is made out to be krystal asks josh what do you think they got wrong here josh basically they got everything wrong renewable energy works renewable energy is the only way we can safely decarbonize the planet on a massive scale i m not saying this as an opinion it is a fact to attack the basic premise that renewable energy works is patently absurd and the film does this over and over they show solar panels from twelve years ago they said solar panels are light years in the past in terms of renewable energy development their is more energy going into building this wind farm than is coming out this absolute nonsense and is on the level of fossil fuel misinformation and that s what i go into in my piece meet the flack of oil and gas michael moore enjeti to play devils advocate here josh takes off eye glasses we need to talk about the growth of population and of consumption by humans in a capital system what s your response to that josh places eye glasses on josh there are so many different responses to that first of all renewable energy does work we have an incredible proliferation of a renewable plant peer reviewed and tested by science so to say that it can t make up the gap is untrue it is a challenge and it will require a fdr like mobilization such as the world has not seen fuckin answer the question would you the ipcc is telling us that we have to if you are going to make a similar argument in terms of population without dealing in renewable energy without dealing with other forms of decarbonization you are talking about cutting the population in half now that sounds to me like ecofacism that sounds to me like extraordinarily scary this films trots out old white men after old white men telling us we need to reduce population krystal i want to be fair josh i watched the film they don t say that we consume more as a wealthy nation than an impoverished nation of the world do now that technology has evolved so that renewable energy actually is a workable solution they moore contends that we can t continue living the way we are and solar and wind will magically fix it josh renewable is not magic it is science what this film has done is taken arguments from years ago and put them in the future right now this film completely ignores the renewable energy and the environmental movement of the last ten years advocating for population control at a moment when we are in a global pandemic that is raging out of control is unconscionable enjeti i did press them about advocating for population control they denied it josh hold on a second when you say renewable energy doesn t work and when you say the population is the problem that is obviously an inference of mumbles we have a way out krystal another part of the film that you are critical of is biofuel and biomass josh the film is obsessed with biomass they bring up biomass for about minutes in the film people don t have a ready understanding of renewable energy just like people don t have a ready understanding of other types of technology but this film trots out a solar panel from and says it s the same thing this film capitalizes on the fact that people don t understand renewable energy and renewable energy literacy is low and that is deceptive and they know it s deceptive amp xb the last statement got me off the couch and on the keyboard i take issue with people who claim they have the answer and the rest of us are too simple to understand such concepts such as global warming caused by fossil fuels fuels that need to be eliminated by switching to renewable energy which can only be created from extracted material from homo collosus toys grrrr william catton would say this is pure cargoism i say let s own up to the situation by acknowledging our condition which is denial

1,d printing automation and localization of economy i m not well versed in d printing and being overly optimistic i had the following idea small communities no larger than a few hundred people at most maybe a church congregation of band together to purchase a few d printers create networks of small gardens and buy some solar panels w batteries to power their printers and create a waste composting system from their sewage and garbage these communities wouldn t go completely off grid rather they would stay connected to the grid to purchase items that they couldn t easily produce locally large vehicles or complex tools that can t be printed easily grains meat electricity on cloudy days etc this would place less demand on our crumbling infrastructure and decrease fuel expenditure since fewer goods would need to be shipped over long distances decentralized manufacturing would lose the economy of scale that we currently have but would d printers be able to offset the increase in costs also if more goods were produced locally then local unemployed people could find employment in the community gardens or delivering the d printed goods to members of the local community also being semi self sufficient gardens means that one is less reliant on full time employment to purchase necessities humanity has survived for thousands of years using these small scale local economies however knowledge of d printing and having some trade with other communities enabled by limited use of large vehicles would enable us to survive without needing to revert to a pre industrial lifestyle we will need to cut back on our consumption though or suffer mass famine please bear in mind that this scenario doesn t account for climate change natural disasters some massive plague etc all of which are pretty damn likely
1,trickle truths vs yelling fire in a theatre i ve been thinking about the pace of news updates lately it feels like there s a growing momentum of events we are being bombarded with there s just so much and it feels louder by the day volcanoes earthquakes changes in weather patterns armed conflict fires all over pollution covid political strife etc the sheer volume is overwhelming we could do a montage of recent events and splice it into the intro of any zombie or apocalyptic movie virtual chaos i keep picturing society as the proverbial frog in a hot pot of water experiment oblivious to the danger as the water boils for many this goes without saying this is r  after all i m wondering about need to know information fed to the general mob population i m not trying to start a debate over what how why or whose projections may come to be imagine for a minute that what s actually going on is bigger and worse than anyone can cope with if we got an emergency announcement of a massive asteroid super volcano enter any scenario coming without time to plan survival people would lose their shit there d be chaos and anarchy as people panic and stampede deeper into stupidity from a herd management perspective wouldn t it make more sense to give people tiny doses of reality until they are desensitized and more easily managed what about distracting people with your left hand so they get sucker punched with the right what if what we see reported is the sugar coating on a very jagged pill tl dr what if we are being micro dosed with harrowing truths so we don t run around like we have bats in our hair

1,try to appreciate what is still hanging on i thought about making this a comment in the weekly observation thread but i m feeling verbose this morning i m on my fourth cup of tea and i still can t face the day to paraphrase lightfoot i really can t bitch about my location i m on lake ontario which while a polluted shell of its former self is still very beautiful i can see loons and otters from my window these days though far enough off i d need to go for a walk to really see them it s still very nice to see they re still there the otters have had a secret population here for a long time and they only shared it with me in the past weeks i found out while observing them socially distanced with a few of the long time locals their boldness is likely due to our staying at home more and i m enjoying their clear enjoyment of it a beaver has started construction in a local creek which is a plan sure to backfire here but it shows they too are still hanging on the birds are down a lot and have been all winter the bugs are probably down from last year but i need to get off my ass more before i say that then again without the birds it may be more difficult to tell i see a few starlings which i tend to loathe for their blind belligerence and the occasional seagull which i detest for the same reason in the absence of all other birds a part of me wants to enjoy them their presence their willingness to exist in this catastrophe we call human society another part of me reminds me they still exist for their blind belligerence probably i ve learned to accept a lot i ve compelled myself to better accept my self and to do this i had to accept what is happening to my environment to our shared environment i ve watched the bugs decline for more than thirty years of paying attention i enjoy them immensely i ve had interactions with damselflies that rival human interactions in value to me they re still hanging on i ve got this abundance of somber acceptance in the stead of the morbid depression i suffered myself for so long and i don t know quite what to do with it with this time we have before things get noticeably worse than they are i do know that i still enjoy observing that which exists especially other kinds of life so i m going to leverage whatever amount of time i have and do what i do which is take pictures of whatever life i find interesting out there if it ll fit in my bag and taking it won t cause undue harm i ll put it under my microscope when i get home to do stuff like this my butterfly specimens are all roadkills i collected last summer i m going to avoid all other human beings and go for a hike right now using this benevolently intended rant to motivate myself because i can be a lazy fuck i m not immune to denial but today i claim the right of honest self determination brow furrowing intensifies no more tea to appreciate these things and to use them as a source of honest enjoyment of strength you have to go out there and see them in a way i think that s the least we can do to observe that which we re destroying before they re gone to seize and reclaim some portion of our former innocent enjoyment of these things and to accept that these animals exist all around us as involuntarily as we exist whether we see them or not to witness that their day to day isn t all bad nor all good but in the many cases we can easily witness usually it s still tenable tenable is a good thing for us to shoot for too i think there s a lesson here i m not sure how this might go over but hey i m taking a shot for those still shut in due to quarantines maybe the pictures will be enjoyed they re all ontario flora and fauna i shoot them for my own enjoyment but i get a certain amount of secondary enjoyment from sharing them here when i get a chance stay safe but take a hike

1,this is what i m doing what about you here s a general summary of the steps i m taking to prepare for a society without structural legal foundations that s likely on it s way i m assuming that things are going to start to get rough and i m going to have to start paving my own way by this post is a rough guideline of what i m intending on doing over the next few months to a year and it is my hope that it can be a blueprint to people that are joining the whole  movement as well as a place for people to discuss their own strategies and critique mine developing physically i ve started a strict exercise regime involving visiting the gym days a week taking natural supplements going on a strict diet regime and engaging in regular cardio i m eliminating as many distractions from my life including television alcohol drugs etc and focusing on achieving peak physical performance figuring out how things work i ve got about books on basic machinery and technologies that i m planning on going through over the next or months i recommend following some of michael ruppert s work as he makes some book suggestions on preparations learning how to live off the land i m taking a course at my local university on the fundamentals of agriculture and farming there s a local scrapper group that s built a small plot of soil to practice botany and gardening in and i m joining them to learn simple agriculture learning marksmanship i ve joined a local gun range and after completing gun licensing intend on learning basic marksmanship i m saving up some money to eventually purchase a firearm any tips or references on this matter will be useful educating myself on the  i ve got a background in finance and economics so i understand the fundamentals but i m reading everything i can to acknowledge the tell tale warning signs qe minor defaults taxation spikes etc and prepare accordingly one thing you ll notice in this list is that i am not preparing any kind of shelter there are two reasons for this i don t have a permanent residence since i m a student and i frequently move between two cities and if there is indeed a  of a magnitude in which i will need a protective shelter given the high population densities in the city in which i live it ll most likely be ransacked early anyway that s my general strategy each of those items i m planning on developing over the next months so that i ll be aptly prepared for the worst come end of thoughts suggestions your strategies

1,the current presidency is going to cause a huge amount of serious problems when it comes to employment wages and economic prosperity and i feel it s intentional due to the covid pandemic the world has understandably been impacted in many ways but while the human cost is due to the virus the economic cost is due to us the us since the start of the pandemic went on an extreme printing spree like never seen before this continues under the current presideny the majority of the money ever printed in the us was printed in just these two years and as a result we re already seeing high levels of inflation and increases to the cost of living the fed of course is pretending things are fine you could argue the money was necessary for the people ignore the fact many of these stimulus packages actually sent billions to lobbyists and billionaires thanks congress americans have essentially got a short term payment with money that has no labour backing and is technically worth much less in exchange they re going to get long term economic problems and inflation that will decimate their savings and their ability to live normal lives it s a very subtle but forceful means of taxation in a way let s talk about wages the current presidency is pushing for dollar minimum wage before i used to support it but considering the current situation that new wage may be necessary only because inflation has already forced you to pay more just to live dollars an hour won t be worth dollars an hour anymore due to the constant printing as the value of the dollar drops let s talk about jobs because this is a very important point biden has proposed that big businesses be taxed more and pay employees dollars an hour but he also suggest free trade no tariffs and such what this means is that say it costs a big businesses million to increase wages and million in taxation they could technically send all their jobs to china and just import the goods back in for a cheaper price it s essentially shipping off our jobs now i do believe in fair wages and fair taxation but biden had effectively gave these corporations a massive loophole and on the note of jobs biden has planned to extend unemployment benefits we have the jobs but nobody wants to take them because unemployment benefits pay more this unemployment money is coming from a money printer effectively people are getting money with no labour backing to buy goods many of these goods nobody is making anymore because they re on unemployment if corporations can t fill these jobs then they re either going to get automated faster or bring in people who are willing to work for much less typically vulnerable immigrants the us suffered through the pandemic badly but the economic reaction to the pandemic will cause far more damage and harm for years to come and i feel the current presidency is only fanning the flames of this new depression the prospect of hyperinflation isn t far fetched anymore and it s the common people who will get screwed over the most biden won t be around on this earth for long but his and the previous administrations actions will have long lasting effects long after they re gone

1,how possible is it that the wuhan coronavirus originated from wuhan s maximum security biolab this article in nature about a new seven biosafety level bsl biolab in wuhan is making the rounds it opens by saying gt some scientists outside china worry about pathogens escaping and the addition of a biological dimension to geopolitical tensions between china and other nations although there are other high security biolabs in the world at least one was operated with a hell of a lot more caution according to the article gt the first bsl lab in japan was built in but operated with lower risk pathogens until when safety concerns were finally overcome the article also states gt but worries surround the chinese lab too the sars virus has escaped from high level containment facilities in beijing multiple times notes richard ebright a molecular biologist at rutgers university in piscataway new jersey tim trevan founder of chrome biosafety and biosecurity consulting in damascus maryland says that an open culture is important to keeping bsl labs safe and he questions how easy this will be in china where society emphasizes hierarchy diversity of viewpoint flat structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important he says and then gt but ebright is not convinced of the need for more than one bsl lab in mainland china he suspects that the expansion there is a reaction to the networks in the united states and europe which he says are also unwarranted he adds that governments will assume that such excess capacity is for the potential development of bioweapons gt these facilities are inherently dual use he says the prospect of ramping up opportunities to inject monkeys with pathogens also worries rather than excites him they can run they can scratch they can bite this article is alarming but epidemiology is not my purview how likely is it that the official narrative that the virus came from a market selling illegal infected meat is false and the virus actually came from this lab is there any way to tell at this juncture i really wonder what the guy warning about the safety issues has to say if the pathogen is from the lab that could explain why they ve taken the as far as i can tell unprecedented step of locking down two cities wuhan and huanggang whose total populations are mil if it is from the lab that would seem to indicate this is a more serious event and could more likely lead to a devastating  inducing pandemic i suppose even if the current outbreak is not due to the lab it still sounds like a bit of a ticking time bomb  wise due to how lax china s standards tend to be

1,kind of ridiculous but here s a carbon sequestration plan i know it s not going to solve any problem at best it softens our crash i know it s nearly impossible to get funding or raise interest in such ideas whatever i d rather try than not try so without further ado here s the idea a rich person company builds canals that are between tidal maximum and minimum heights using tesla valves to guide flow these canals periodically replenish flooded plains making it a passive system besides maintenance and initial construction the saltwater flood plains would be supplemented by agricultural run off to optimize salinity and provide phosphates why phosphates and salinity optimization because these flood plains would be azolla farms azolla is a water fern that reproduces twenty percent of its mass per day in optimal conditions if you haven t heard many scientists theorize that azolla turned the eucene thermal maximum around it s great at carbon sequestration and it performs its own nitrogen fixation through symbiosis with cyanobacteria because it performs its own nitrogen fixation azolla can be used as a green fertilizer easing reliance on fossil fuel derived fertilizers if the phosphates are managed properly this system could also ease the burden of agricultural run off contributing to algae blooms off the coast a problem leads to mass fish die offs in many coastal regions today for now this idea seems scalable to me and could even prove profitable in the narrow capitalistic sense profitability as much as many people dislike the word might very well be crucial for the project to have any attraction to the wealthy i ve tried to pitch this idea to the prizex carbon sequestration people but i haven t been able to get their attention it s true i wanted to get the credit for this idea so i was reluctant to put it out there before i could get people with power interested but it s time to put that kind of interest aside i ve been doing research on what conditions azolla needs it can survive in brackish conditions and at relatively high temperatures if made to adapt during early growth stages it doesn t need a lot of fertilizer due to its ability to pull nitrogen out of the air it can also be used as a fish and poultry food so there s that as well i don t know what else to say i don t know where to start there isn t any reasonable way for me to fund this type of project by myself or even begin experimentation any time soon i m just probing around everyone i know personally is somewhat narcissistic and has little to no faith in pretty much every word that comes out of the mouths of everybody besides themselves if this is idiotic my apologies i m staring down the horizon of my life recognition shouldn t matter anyway and it certainly won t matter when i m dead so i m throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks peace whatever that means to you jo

1,countrify the city even rome in the end was swallowed up and provincialized by its military the word civilization coupled with the adjective western has of late come under the suspicion that it truckles to an exclusivist view of european superiority the unfortunate obverse of civilized that springs to mind is savage primitive barbarian this needless to say isn t the semantic binary in which i wish to put the word civilization nor in fact will my use of the term rest on the meaning given to it by nineteenth century historians to designate large scale clusters of cultures held together by geography religion and customs though this technical definition of civilization does circumscribe the geopolitical area of my survey i will actually prefer a more humble yet sociologically pertinent and etymologically correct use of civilization one that cracks its abstract shell and brings out the socio lexical nugget civilization is per verbum that which pertains to the city it is the mix of beliefs attitudes mores practices economic habits and moral sensibilities that associated with city life actually civilization elbows its way into the english lexicon in the chaotically urbanizing eighteenth century the word evoked the effects of bringing people out of rusticity and inducting them into the ways of town living civil civility civilian civilized and civilization are whatever happens when homo civitatis the town dwelling creature replaces homo agri the agriculturalist on the cultural driver s seat and what has been happening in the city with many false starts and detours since years ago in the lowlands of mesopotamia is the development exchange multiplication and hybridization of ideas technologies systems of thoughts religions and polities the city is where the division and diversity of labor is most developed where commercial networks are densest and busiest where political power administrations systems of record keeping and accounting congregate as well as the education apparatus the literacy and numeracy to run them a city in sum is where culture adopts managerial and argumentative methods to its own maintenance the word culture often appears in duality with civilization and so we a pause to explore their disjunction it goes back to a polemic begun by german romantics of the late eighteenth century kultur in their scheme was the native ancestral na ve and wise ways of a locality a folk an ethnicity a kin group at the opposite end zivilization was cosmopolitan rootless abstract impersonal and deplorably french zivilization was the enlightenment reason the demystifying encyclop die the technocracy paris it was fretful knowing and cynical a far cry from the shire the glen and the clan of kultur as sheltering and solid as the german forest this invidious distinction between overweening judgmental rootless and artificial civilization and sincere natural communal and colorful culture is one of the more durable exports of romanticism civilization conjures up the image of an imperialistic juggernaut trampling over regional pluralities crushing local colors and colored people with the myth of its own pre eminence and digesting every neighbor it comes across next to it culture seems a model of pacific non interference though not necessarily tolerant a culture revolves around concrete practices interactions and interests it is too local and self referential to meddle with other cultures and seldom devises policies to formulate and impose itself universally these broadly are the lines of the zivilization kultur feud whose merits this is not the place to discuss suffice it to remark upon one useful facet of the dichotomy which is that civilization tends to articulate its identity and explain itself to its members arguing about its values in a way that a culture by nature more autarkic doesn t or does but to a much lesser degree and less critical extent and when we consider what the romantics had primarily in mind when lambasting civilization we supposedly the big bad bustling countryside s civitas the arrogantly cosmopolitan city that sucks up all the bounty and gives nothing but unwanted advice in return civilization given a strictly sociological perspective is the culture of the city it is what happens to culture when it makes a city its port of call and the city is first of all dense interaction between people trades and occupations this is where forms of life and belief become cognizant of one another and start a mad competitive race as the division of labor ramifies and the contest between economic sectors heats up the rate of innovation springs to life rural neighboring communities do swap ideas of course but these tend to be of a similar stamp and involve variants of ideas already extant genuine new springs of information open up when commerce and industry bring together people from far and wide in the urban latticework of information knowledge grows more voluminous and varied it challenges itself on the agora the forum or the commons thus something happens to the quality of urban based knowledge it tends to be more context independent and critically aware of itself knowledge gets defined as a technical demystified means citied culture is culture becoming instrumental objectified as some say uprooted this uprooting it appears is at the origin of all major civilizations identified by longue dur e historians arnold toynbee pitirim sorokin alfred kroeber caroll quigley jean bodin fernand braudel whether mesopotamian egyptian sinic indic greek roman christian arabic khmer and mesoamerican all these civilizations radiate out of or graft themselves onto urban hubs of course it s not always the case that having a city at the core means that culture will citify it happened many times throughout history that warlords and landlords were able to countrify the city planting their courts on top of the ready supply of urban labor and easily seized booty and commercial routes all this without adopting the mindset of the city in ancient sumer egypt and china the princely court prevailed and feudalized the city even rome in the end was swallowed up and provincialized by its military according to fernand braudel this courtification or imperialization of the city was rather the rule in world history until it ran into an exception this oddity took place around the eleventh century ce in the far northwest corner of the eurasian landmass a geographical area which at the time was in political disarray frayed and tottering after the dismantling of the short lived carolingian empire with no prince powerful enough to put the land under his yoke cities between the loire and rhine rivers and of the italian peninsula were given leave to grow develop a taste of self rule a legal system of exemptions and liberties together with the city walls to protect them which by the time feudal barons turned their greedy eyes to them found they could not terrorize as braudel explains the miracle of the first great urban centuries in europe was that the city won hands down against the state of course the king s court had its revenge in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but eventually with the commercial age the city did citify the martial and ecclesiastical elite then the countryside and the state at large creating what the german romantics called the poison of civilization a society that maintains a skeptical utilitarian rationalizing stance vis vis its own lifeways an imagined community made up of citi zens who unlike deni zens or denisein e g acculturated indwellers stand inside and outside at the same time looking outward looking inward never entirely and reliably autochthonous

1,information fatigue i ve noticed in myself and others that the facts figures and scale of climate change are so overwhelmingly negative and require such drastic widespread and immediate social political and economic change that people can t even handle it they just tune out and climate change becomes like background radiation in the hive mind a constant static noise that everyone is just ignoring i don t see any way to fix this any suggestions

1,the dream crusher fossil fuel use the only difference between and is that we added more energy in the form of solar and wind power world energy transitions take generations to do that s years we have to reduce emissions in years we have no real idea how to do this and most of our green energy is fraud we got years to change everything here s what we accomplished over the last years of fighting climate change if you are years old emissions went up in your lifetime if you are years old emissions went up in your lifetime as you can see our only success has been bullshit if you think bernie sanders is going to save us in any way shape or form then fine but i don t see any difference between believing bernie sanders or jesus christ i d rather drop lsd or mescaline why climate change is so hard to tackle our stubborn energy system axios seems to believe the democrats will save us lol coal s lingering role complicates climate change efforts kemp in years coal use will drop to by from today but in absolute terms global coal will rise to quadrillion btus in up from quadrillion btus in
1,the spectrum of climate change possibilities here s how i see the spectrum of climate change possibilities at the moment from most optimistic to most pessimistic the conspiracy cc is fake and it s a leftist plot for authoritarian control unequivocally false imo the denial cc is real but humans aren t causing it won t have negative consequences unequivocally false imo the utopian techno optimism cc is real humans are causing it there could be negative consequences but not only will we transition soon via technology and legislation to renewables we will even suck back our previous emissions and we ll even create jobs without suffering barely any climate consequences extremely unlikely imo the optimist cc is real and it s our fault and we will have negative consequences but we will transition soon via tech and legislation to renewables though we will still deal with c of warming very unlikely imo the realist cc is real and it s our fault and we will suffer a lot because we couldn t transition soon enough to renewables due to scope of the issue and the conflicting interests preventing a worldwide consensus in time a lot of economic damage and human misery is already locked in somewhat likely imo the pessimist cc is real and it s our fault and we will suffer greatly because we will only truly transition to renewables when the first impacts are felt which will mean it s too late and a lot of damage has been locked in an unimaginable amount of human misery will come and many civilizations will  with some parts of the earth becoming permanently uninhabitable somewhat likely imo the doomsayer cc is real and it s our fault and it won t matter if we transition to renewables because certain tipping points will be reached that begin a negative feedback loop completely outside our control and will result in the likely  of all human industrial civilization and even the extinction of the human species unlikely imo the runaway apocalypse cc is real and it s our fault and it won t matter if we transition to renewables because all tipping points have been reached or will be reached to cause a runaway greenhouse effect leading to the extinction of all life on earth and the transformation of the planet into a venus either permanently or long enough that it won t matter anyway very unlikely imo as you can see i m currently on points in my beliefs my perception of this sub is that most are closer to point perhaps thinking that all human civilization will  but that the species won t go extinct if that s the case i d like to hear your arguments and any resources you may have to support them videos pdfs books papers etc i know that civilization is fragile but if you can show me exactly how fragile it is and what kind of damage is likely to happen and has already been locked in then i could easily change my mind

1,i m surprised religion hasn t jumped on climate change yet i was driving home from work yesterday when i passed a bus for a noah s ark daycare and it really got me thinking the story of noah is one of the world being wiped out because of man s mistakes this has a very eerie parallel to climate change i m surprised that there aren t religious movements jumping up embracing the idea that climate change is just god s latest culling of the herd and god doesn t even need to do it this time man has developed to the point he can destroy himself god just needs to save his chosen righteous few don t get me wrong it s a horrible idea to believe this but religions have sprouted up over ideas with less merit

1,transition engineering what s the chance that this catches on in time this idea was put forward in i think it s far too late since it would take years for people to even become aware that we need a transition by that point we ll be further along in peak oil and it ll be too late to transition fast enough by the time this problem is studied i think we ll realize it s too late we d have to be doing this stuff now because each year that goes by where we re just building more cars highways office towers and suburbs just makes the problem worse
1,could china have planned this my theory is that china is sort of happy about what s happening to the west with covid i don t think they deliberately engineered the virus in a bio lab but once it got out they may have let it spread unimpeded just to get back at us it seems they knew how bad and deadly the virus was back in december yet did nothing to stop travel to china or restrict internal chinese travel what gives
1,corona virus does anyone else see the danger in how fast the number of infected has doubled at ground zero and how fast the death toll has racked up there too especially considering that they underreport deaths and illnesses it s not how many have gotten overseas it s how fast the number of sick doubles in one population that is foreboding also since in the usa sick days are cause for retribution how many of your food service workers will make you sick to keep from getting a write up what in the hell is the government doing to prevent that we can t quarantine people like china can because too many have guns and are organized they will blast their way out and others will join them making the problem worse than before we don t know the incubation period or anything now what

1,economic  will happen sooner than climate  in the past years the central bankers have leveraged the world assets to terraform this planet at an incredible pace that could never have been achieved without fractional reserve lending amp the use of money credit mortgaging and plundering the wealth of future generations quadrupled the human population in years this model is not sustainable because it relies on growth and growth has its limits when there no there are no new suckers to exploit growth ceases to exist we have hit peak everything peak student loans peak real estate peak consumer debt peak corporate debt peak population when these assets contract and crash pensions stocks savings and home equity will be eliminated the economies of the world are shrinking and there no new suckers to bail us out because the economies of the world are maxed out the feds will react by printing massive amounts of money to lessen the blow via inflation forced austerity will shrink the population those who rely on federal aid and other federal programs like medicare and social security will be wiped out the military will be forced to shrink populist demagogues worldwide will seize the opportunity for conquest after the american military goes bankrupt and is no longer a threat economic downturns and war are the catalysts the engines that force innovation if we are to fix climate change this will be the way to do it because china america europe and the billionaires and politicians will not cooperate until the bitter end i don t see any other way out human capital is subject to corrections the year surge in population is not sustainable when autonomous technology goes parabolic the need for human capital will shrink how we transition into an autonomous world will decide the fate of billions for once let s hope humans cooperate but i m not counting on it
1,overpopulation and eugenics epstein style at one session at harvard mr epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation said mr pinker who was there yes that mr epstein you can read the entire article here this is the problem with people trying to control overpopulation with an eye towards ending life early it always becomes about eugenics which we all know is usually racist i felt this was pertinent to this sub to understand the pushback for  to be avoided most argue that over population needs to be avoided one could argue we are already in overshoot so at this point it s moot i am very interested to see if you feel we are in overshoot and if so is it moot to address

1, vs tech innovation the centers of civilization can live without support system in gail tverberg s blog the poster smite was smiting the blog into irrelavency when the poster pintada appeared smite probably new in that kind of forum refused to explain his positions further and became aggressive essentially losing the argument however these posters appear to be not conversant with history so while i have nothing to do with smite whatsoever i will counter some of their points gt how many companies will continue to do robotics and ai research after of the population is starving look at north korea gt robots will not replace corn wheat potatoes and those plants cannot be grown without debt fuel and massive amounts of fresh water fine they won t be grown in the scale needed to feed the masses however there will be entrepreneurs who will be willing to grow for these people in exchange to some concessions every tyrant had his supporters it is patently absurd to imagine that an economy of any scale will be created by the richest after the are hungry and unemployed due to the problems gail discusses see above north korea it does not have an economy it only has nukes satellites and hydrogen bombs gt the fancy ai robots do not exist yet they will never exist because the  will happen or begin in earnest if you a long decent person well before they can be developed and produced in sufficient quantities to be important web based solutions only need one single server may be more than one physical computer but one single server cluster to process the stuff from thousands of miles away even if you are locked in your bunker as long as you have connections you will be able to process your payroll without ever getting out of there in the middle of that discussion there was this argument about whether a world serving the would be able to innovate and advance civilization such was the norm of history for all of human existence till around but he seemed to be not aware of this inconvenient fact then the poster ed said this which is worth a separate post gt ert yes economy of scale is hotly debated here it would be the owners workers our robot friends in truth it is not clear to me what size economy is needed to maintain approximately the current technology level gt i would argue the economy is bifurcated today san fransisco and new york city could get by fine without the fly over states london would be fine without europe a right sized shanghai without rural china that is where the rule has changed tainter and turchin do not understand that the old rule no longer works what happens is the chips could be produced in the centers of civilization if needed just stockpile enough material long before and store them in underground storage and other spaces now storing a bunch of junk obviously in this kind of scenario the property rights of non essential personnel won t be worth much when  will be likely to occur food will be stockpiled again there will be entrepreneurs who are willing to risk a lot of things to sell food to them when napoleon and his troops were at the verge of freezing to death at eylau which was in the middle of nowhere in a region with very poor roads a daring entrepreneur appeared literally from the sky and sold them rum obviously for a very high price which was enough to keep them alive to fight on and eventually crush the enemy at friedland later read the ww story of the daredevils trying to deliver supplies to the garrison at malta or to murmansk ussr full of german uboats it is not as easy as some instadoomers would like to be speaking about ww ussr scientific researches continued in besieged leningrad where a few researchers starved to death rather than eating the experimental crops they were working at it does not take as much resources as we spend now to feed maybe of the pop in a crisis situation as long as the techies are fed and protected and some of their family members as well tech advances will occur what will limit it is the shortcomings of the techies even smite did admit that many programmers are short of skills innovation will stop because of the possible lack of intelligence not because of

1,turning back the tide of  by heroic measures as an amateur local historian i have looked at some of the efforts made in the s here in germany where it was once attempted how much worse is the situation today was it too late then is it too late now hint no yes the dawn has risen but where is the sun this day will bring a storm rumbling clouds loom on the horizon now all the air is heated fire is the breath of the earth nota bene the early s are addressed here i do not believe that the horrors of the s were remotely in people s minds back then in the non bolshevik world i personally have lived my entire adult life in foreign countries i do not practise racism but am well aware of it i believe you should question everything once as i have watched the natural world  around me after a lifetime of watching it closely i am moved to ask are we worse than the nazis and will people see it that way in the future preamble fascism fighting fire with fire i cannot in good conscience recommend fascism but one might consider its smaller sibling nationalism is awful but almost anything gt globalism globalism is the great  enabler globalism can probably be successfully combated dissolving nations is much harder to do without violence which we are avoiding for now the notion that perfect global cooperation would solve mankind s problems is not accepted the notion that your own personal piece of earth can be improved by you yourself under you own power is given cnut s conundrum put away the big dreams of glory look to the ground beneath your feet for soon if you cannot live off it the stars are not wanted now put out every one pack up the moon and dismantle the sun pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood for nothing now can ever come to any good alternatively you can roll up your sleeves and start improving it you should be able to be nationalist without being racist especially if your country is not ethnically homogeneous i cannot see that racism is necessarily a consequence of racism i do not see why nationalists are now racists why would they choose the weakest policies of failed regimes instead of rejecting them and taking up useful ones if the germans had not started the s by gifting the future allies with an entire collection of german scientists they would have had a walkover man is much too good at cooperating look how we got to the bloody nation state in the first place at least use it to start destroying international commerce up with the trade tariffs down with ttip sort your own land out first right now it seems to me that s what people signed up for here in rural lower saxony it is the tragedy of the world that they were so shamefully betrayed by their leadership if ever there were a people who might have managed to create a self sustaining mutually beneficial relationship with their land if you can t do that then you don t belong in the ecosystem and then where do you belong preamble gt autarky vs imperialism this shows how the world was divided amongst the great empires of the time the versailles treaty had deprived germany of her colonies whilst the rest of the gang were propping up their unsustainable systems by imperial exploitation just as we are doing today except of course now we are stealing from the future and not merely from the weaker making a virtue from necessity germany would turn her back as far as possible from imports and attempt to live off the resources she could produce from her own land some progress was made till hitler tempted by stalin blundered into poland and gave his enemies an excuse for war it was all downhill from there on of course the accompanying text claims that at the time that the number of people supported per square kilometre was as follows british empire soviet union french empire usa germany capacity gha now that imperialism is an evil of the past the figures are measured as global footprints in global hectares per person there are hectares in square kilometre i have produced the following comparable table british empire russia the only ones on this list living within national means french empire usa germany there are some obvious but nevertheless interesting figures here but clearly either consumption must be reduced or the land must be structured to produce enough n b all the images below are commented and translated in imgur the images themselves are from the atlas of niedersachsen between the elections of november and march there was an initiative in lower saxony to make a complete survey of the state when i say complete i mean literally they counted every tree every chicken every crop in every field every person every car that gives us a pretty good idea of the state of play i have chosen about graphics and maps here to introduce the subject there are over a more if there is interest driven good farming land by desperation this is the core you cannot keep pushing the poor off the land into the cities and keep expecting them to feed from that land urbanisation will kill the land no land to live off no more people size of communities aristotle was of the opinion that the ideal size for a polis was ca it s a trade off everyone should know everybody else in the community but not breed with close relatives here it seems to be reduced to a threshold of given that an efficiently connected network of germanic villages might get around the inbreeding restraints that would have concerned the ancient greeks might make this lower level acceptable work opportunities this is literally getting stuff done by sheer manpower digging and building with the simplest of tools in exchange for food shelter and pocket money efficacy of back to work program almost all blue collar jobs population growth and the trend towards urban outweighing rural the lay of the land before british style improvements thanks to the royal house of hanover as you can see this is a land of moors and heaths it flooding and draining with the ice ages scoured by glaciers the soil is hard and poor it s only in the last few millennia that man has managed to settle here prehistoric people avoided this as uninhabitable afterwards many of these improvements became wasteland more forest hunting grounds for the rich moors and wastelands lands that can usefully be drained and improved these match up with the sponsored work opportunities and can become human habitat given a massive labour input rural labourers and their knowhow are lost in exchange for industrial toilers and the unskilled how the land is used red and blue are opportunities dark brown that s been taken forever enclosures one of those outrageous british improvements this is my favourite map and it is of interest to both left and right as it is one of the fundamental injustices see the comments this demonstrates the to be readopted ancient germanic field designs settlement design with real life examples and links to the settlements as they are today demographics with the huge war losses and post war hardship and birth strike this is the population that did the work old people kids not a demographic to plan on a war anytime soon btw that gaping hole is the young men in detailed birth rates and war caused gender imbalances

1,question capitalism vs communism doesn t industrialized civilization lead to the destruction of the planet regardless i understand that capitalism has driven our destruction of the planet through the mindset of continuous growth infinite growth cannot happen on a planet with finite resources but would communism or socialism be any better i feel like the problem sits with industrialized society itself rather than economic structure i would assume that a communist society would still be industrialized as marx thought in terms of industrialized societies in some ways communism and socialism may be even worse given the lack of innovation seen under these systems one can argue that innovation has led to an acceleration in our process of exploiting the planet however under a communist system a lack of innovation and competition merely removes the incentive to the reduce waste seen in any industrialized society plus constant growth can t even be scene as an exclusively capitalist phenomenon communism and socialism advocate for the re distribution of wealth this will simply lead to more consumption even if wealthy individuals consume at a high rate a larger group would consume more if this wealth was distributed to them consumption is the true enemy and is essential to any industrialized society for instance as third world countries develop people begin to drive cars eat meat own appliances and engage in many other wasteful practices common in the developed world if the lifestyles of those in the developed world are already leading to the unsustainable exploitation of earth s resources its pretty easy to see what s going to happen when millions of others start living the same way its inevitable that we will suck this planet dry
1,dogmatic progressivism traditionalism and  i have a deep concern that wells of knowledge are becoming increasingly radicalized in terms of their worldview and that inconvenient facts are either ignored or mutilated to fit this tribalistic narrative ultimately i believe this may be the actual mechanism of civilizational  let s take reddit s  board for example obviously the overwhelming concern has been rightly in my view climate change there is overwhelming data to support that climate change is man made and an existential risk to civilization so it makes sense that the dominant concern of the  board is climate change but only one political ideology actively acknowledges or at least does not minimize the threat of climate change progressivism conservatism or traditionalism both either deny it or seek to minimize it what s interesting then is that this board has slowly devolved closer and closer to the worldview of progressives a community ostensibly created to discuss unaddressed existential risks has itself decayed into a community incapable of discussing existential risks what do i mean acknowledgement of this critical risk from an unbiased point of view attracts people who previously adopted the concern out of tribal conformity therfore as the community grows more and more tribalists participate and skew the overall information load towards their biased viewpoint the tribalists are interested in conformity not truth so inconvenient facts or alternative points of view will be shouted down or marginalized no matter their merit heretics are created and eventually the community itself s into religiosity this board is becoming incapable of handling any  vector that is incongruent with a progressive worldview for example there is a rich historical literature that mass immigration cultural incompatibility or race differences may be critical civilizational  vectors thinkers from gibbons to brooke adams to arnold toynbee have acknowledged it as such more recently nicolas wade s book a troublesome inheritance has difficult implications yet this form of civilizational decay is acknowledged only by the radical conservative traditionalist types the alt right being the modern incantation it is anathema to progressivism who talk a radical one world one people no borders approach and so discussion of this potential  vector is shuffled away i could go on but the point is that each side digs its heals in ideologically almost religiously and is therefore more concerned with group status and tribalism then any real action or even discussion of the actual truth in the end tribalism is  and so it goes

1,illuminating quotes from john michael greer gt the core hypothesis shaping my view of the future is the proposal that our time differs from the past only in the way that one past era differs from another the notion that the present epoch is utterly unique in history popular as that is fails to convince me and the habit of using that notion as an excuse to project an assortment of utopian and apocalyptic fantasies on the inkblot patterns of the future strikes me as frankly delusional it makes more sense i think to recognize that imperial overstretch is imperial overstretch no matter what technologies the empire in question happens to use and that trying to make sense of the future on the basis of historical parallels is a more useful strategy than insisting that the future must conform to our desires our fears or both at once gt the end of a civilization follows the famous rule attributed to william gibson the future is already here it s just not evenly distributed yet put another way the impacts of decline and fall aren t uniform they vary in intensity over space and time and they impact particular systems of a falling civilization at different times and in different ways if you re in the wrong place at the wrong time and depend on the wrong systems to support you your chances aren t good but the places times and systems that take the brunt of the  aren t random gt the difference between my view and that of many others in the  field is that a lot of them assume that the first wave of crisis will be followed by total  and i argue that it ll be followed by muddling through and partial recovery then by renewed crisis and so on thus i don t think it s actually that useful to have a single metric for what counts as  because  is a process not an event the  of industrial civilization has been under way for quite some time now and will still be a going concern for longer than any of us will be alive gt we re way past the point at which it s possible to prevent the decline and fall of industrial civilization and no this notion of flinging trillion we don t have in an attempt to build technologies that aren t economically viable and require resources that are already gone doesn t offer a way out of that gt at this point thirty years after the point at which we would have had to get started it s all very well to talk about some sort of grand transition to sustainability but the time when such a thing would have been possible came and went decades ago we could have chosen that path but we didn t and insisting thirty years after the fact that we ve changed our minds and want a different future than the one we chose isn t likely to make any kind of difference that matters gt the pessimists all insist that the crises we face are greater than ever before the optimists all insist that our capacity to meet the crises is greater than ever before i think they re both right and that their points cancel each other out not surprising as the scale of the crises and the scale of our capacity to respond to them are both functions of the same thing the physical and energetic scale of industrial civilization thus we face the same sort of thing as other civilizations in the past just spread over more territory gt get past the fantasies of sudden  on the one hand and the fantasies of limitless progress on the other and what you get is what we re getting a long ragged slope of rising energy prices economic contraction and political failure punctuated with a crisis here a local or regional catastrophe there a war somewhere else all against a backdrop of disintegrating infrastructure declining living standards decreasing access to health care and similar services and the like which of course has been happening here in the united states for some years already gt don t worry about when the crash will come it s already here this is what  looks like in the real world not a sudden splat but the ragged disintegration of business as usual day by day as the world changes into something else

1,random thoughts the end of oil is the return of misogamy i saw this thought online gt women s egos are soaring take a look around western civilization is mired in full blown gynocentrism everything revolves around girls and women there are only two identities now unisex androgynous and female boy scouts are now unisex but the girl scouts remain women now dress like men by wearing pants unisex but distinctly female dress remains skirts dresses there are only a couple male only universities in the country lots of unisex ones and lots of female only ones and on and on it s true of toilets too women children and unisex toilets no men only in business premises anymore they then go on gt there is an imbalance of energy in the aether swamped with explosive masculine energy coming from fossil fuels men s natural explosive energy coming from testosterone is swamped out by an aether saturated with explosive energy the cosmos restores balance where there is imbalance this is going to be cataclysmic and hilarious i find the premise thesis interesting and sure it s not in my best interests to believe what he s saying but i m a scientist dammit i can look at an idea and not blow it off because it feels upsetting hm point oil has created an explosive energy that s replaced the males testosterone fuelled energy this appears to stand up to a little scrutiny machines now do some of what guys used to do women can use those same machines point the end of high eroei is going to dis empower women if point holds that control of machines is unisex and the machines replaced manual male labour then it s also possible that oil going away will mean the equality between the sexes takes a tumble what s your thoughts
1,long range forecasts are literally impossible during agw week after week after week i m beginning to accept the fact that predicting the weather more than a couple of days in advance is no longer possible i ve seen the forecast change dramatically just days out repeatedly went from being rain to no rain went from being f to f the results of agw make it damn near impossible to predict weather patterns even with advanced satellites we re about to get a freeze which normally wouldn t be a problem in april because freezes in april used to be common not in most of the leaves have already fully emerged and now we re going down into the upper s which is going to totally fuck shit up i m not sure how well fruit trees will survive upper degree weather but i can say with certainty it s going to seriously fuck things up how do people expect to eat food when we can t even manage to produce anything because of crazy weather swings and totally altered regional climates
1,there s a massive transfer of wealth occurring in the global economy right now since the beginning of virtually every single cryptocurrency ever conceived has experienced some fold gains most people who proposed the idea of cryptocurrencies back years ago or longer were considered idiots and the idea stupid now anyone who placed a investment into any cryptocurrency prior to is likely a multi millionaire in my opinion this is very similar to the tech bubble that began in the early to mid s and ended in wealth was created out of no where due to new technology and people who would have never made very much money in conventional society were now multi millionaires and billionaires it seems to me as if there s a revolution occurring right now the exponential uptick in the prices of these digital currencies seems to be one of the most absurd and irrational phenomenon that i ve ever seen for most people these things don t even make sense and for the computer illiterate it s literally one of the most absurd concepts imaginable yet there does seem to be a shift occurring that s beginning to get the attention and to some dismay approval of the mainstream and the governments crypto currencies seem to be changing the concept of investments and currency and there s massive swaths of the population that are being left out just like there were during the s to present this is all rather consistent with the idea of a society that is increasing in complexity at an exponential rate the end is near for our society and our species but in the mean time those who are investing in these strange ideas are becoming millionaires in a matter of months truly demonstrating just how twisted perverted and out of touch with reality our society really has become those who have worked hard their entire lives to earn a retirement or a pension are in the process of being wiped out and bankrupt but a bunch of tech savvy year olds who put dollars they earned at walmart working as a shelf stocker into etherium when it was are now literally worth more than their parents i don t know how this is going to end but i would honestly feel remiss if i didn t stick some of my fake fiat currency into these speculative assets and ride this irrational perverted sick and twisted rocket ship up into the stratosphere
1,how will peak energy and fossil fuels affect global warming if global liquid fossil fuel production is going to peak sometime within the next ten years with a consequent peak in global energy consumption how will this affect climate change as i understand it we are currently on track for four degrees of global warming by which may be optimistic time wise something the scientists james hansen and kevin anderson make a compelling case for if emissions peak around does that mean we might be headed for a lower level of warming which while still incredibly devastating will be a better outcome although it could just be kicking the can down the road i would just like to get people s thoughts on this and any potential sources articles journals etc that touch on peak fossil fuels and energy interacting with climate change

1,feel like a lot of you want the world to end i realize that the world isn t in very great shape right now but we ve gone through many national disasters viruses wars and climate change has been hitting for us for a while i just don t think that things are gna take a huge turn any time soon i can t see the future but a lot of you are too doomer for me i like to explore the idea of societal  and that s why i joined this sub but i just hate it when people only use instances in the world that validate only their own opinion like a couple earth quakes and heat waves aren t going to end the world the only thing i could see ending us anytime soon year time frame is nuclear catastrophe natural disaster extinction level events only like a giant asteroid or ai misunderstood tech and none of those are very likely like i said before i have no idea what the future will bring but none of you do either i m tired of seeing people here saying the world is going to end this year because of covid and wild fires it feels like they are just spreading fear and fud because they themselves are afraid and wish others to feel the same because they are insecure i am not scared no matter what happens because i do not control anything other than my own life so i am indifferent to any forces that are out of my control taking my life on the contrary there are a lot of ideas here that i agree with and even those i do not i am still accepting of them and am glad to explore other peoples ideas if this post is not in accordance w the rules of this sub or i simply get a lot of negative feed back i ll leave respectfully but i thought i would post this since it s been on my mind for a while

1,i kinda want it all to end when i first joined this sub back in july and even before that i used to worry so much about climate change and pollution thinking about human extinction in my lifetime freaked the fuck out of me and i was really hoping for change but as time moved on i started getting enjoyment and relief from the notion that we are approaching the end it just takes so much pressure off of you to know that your actions are insignificant and nothing will matter in a few decades similar feelings i get when i see videos of how small our planet is compared to the entirety of the universe they say ignorance is bliss for me it s insignificance as an ardent anti capitalist seeing the state the world doesn t trouble me nearly as much as it used to anything that would bother me i know will cease to exist not long from now so there is no need for me to care now i actually get off of it hell i don t want us to fix our approach to the end i m happy that it s coming i m not even suicidal perhaps i would be if i cared not caring has really set me free knowing that  is happening is a constant source of relief and a cope mechanism at every point in life for me

1,the coming migration crisis or why europe is screwed i think what people tend to miss in  discussion is the refugee crises everyone likes to talk about a collapsing society but no one thinks of where those people will go and they will go the human drive to live is extremely powerful we are seeing this a little bit right now but this is really just the very small tip of the iceberg in the past refugees have largely been locally contained what mean by that is maybe you had a couple of cities being fought over and a couple of million people trying to flee they may try to leave the country but usually they go to another one close by in the new paradigm you are going to see whole regions emptying out this means that the middle east and north africa will eventually see a humanitarian crisis on the order of million people from a combination of d states war over dwindling resources hint it is not oil and fear people are going to try and get to europe millions are going to die on the way it is going to be excruciating to watch from afar here in america first you are going to have the pain of watching millions die on the journey then when europe notices that they literally have a wall of people coming at them it will be excruciating to watch as calls for humanitarianism fade away to hurried barrier building and large scale violence to secure borders in north america we are geographically secure in this regard large oceans give us a comparative advantage fortress america will live on only extended to include canada and even possibly mexico even though the standard of living may decline in the future we should be safe from wave after wave of humanity crashing against our gates trying to get a loaf of bread or some clean water we have many of the resources necessary for modern life within north america we may seem a fractured nation but in fact america while being diverse is also a very solid entity internally and share many common characteristics with mexico and especially canada as an american get ready to sit back and watch the world slow roll into  from a distance what this will mean politically will be an ever increasing call for isolationism our troops will come home and we will defend the homeland a boat full of venezuelan refugees is approaching florida drone strike we will not even bat a collective eye immigration will become incredibly hard with only top international talent being allowed in the world s intellectual and business elite will march straight to our gates wanting refuge this new reality saddens me greatly as i believe one great strength of the us is that we have taken so many cultures and more or less successfully turned them in an american culture this will stop that going forward however it may just be necessary to preserve what has already been created

1,plan b in case current action on climate change isn t enough if the united states continues to only put effort into stopping climate change every other administration possible that devastation to the biosphere will be unstoppable and irreversible even with the majority of the world trying its best to cut emissions if we ever get to a point where we have seemingly run out of options i suggest doing something drastic to save some of the world s great cities and that thing is building a massive seawall across the strait of gibraltar while you might recognize this scheme from some of the many hypothetical scenarios in which the mediterranean is drained that would not be the intention here rather the seawall would have huge tunnels bored into its base to allow the flow of water and sea life from the atlantic to continue relatively undisrupted that way the water levels of the mediterranean and black seas would not be changed and several big cities in europe and north africa would be spared the same thing could be done with the red sea and the persian hulf albeit with much more massive seawalls as a side note this kind of project also has the benefit of providing a surface on which to pave a highway allowing western europe to easily trade with northern africa without the use of boats

1,dehumidifier condensate a typical  will cause a lot of tension warlords crime etc the water supply will be disrupted or interfered with you need a supply of the purist potable water with a known history i have always been unhappy with the water situation municipalities cannot be relied upon to supply regular clean water and the weather can t be relied upon to rain and fill your jo jo tank because climate change keep jo jo tank water for flushing toilets and crop irrigation a l claimed dehumidifier which consumes only watts seems ideal this ridiculously low power consumption is suitable for solar panel power supply supplies sa is a semi arid country with lots of sunshine and the obtaining use of potable water is vital a dehumidifier doesn t leave you at the mercy of the municipality or the weather if the shit hits the fan and we go mad max over water i am on the east coast and have plenty of humidity the dehumidifier works well is cheap ish and gives me l claimed of purified water a day this is enough for to survive on the number of people in my house consider you would have to risk trying to find and transport clean water and compete with others perhaps violently for this essential commodity you have to have drinkable water you can t do without condensing water from the air will filter out all the nasty stuff hard core preppers reckon drops of bleach per litre of water and leave for an hour kills all biological contaminants so any spores and other biological nastiness are dealt with a total  also implies an erratic or nonexistent power supply the dehumidifier draws about watts solar panels can supply this the price keeps coming down because elon musk and others is doing continuous and intensive research this together with some batteries probably deep cycle would be intended to supply a w output only which will keep the dehumidifier running during the hours of darkness to be charged during the day again the dehumidifier is run off the power supply battery setup permanently and the solar panels charge it up during daylight hours in this way the dehumidifier makes water aside a side effect is that power for regular fans can also be drawn off the solar panels and because the air is drier from the dehumidifier the body s natural cooling mechanism evaporation can come into play because the air is not saturated and the body can sweat this will last longer than air conditioning during global warming results on a dehumidifier test giving water the dehumidifier is of a commercial brand sold where they sell white appliances vacuum cleaners etc the number relates to the efficiency of the dehumidifier by saying how many litres of water they can extract from the air its primary use is drying and filtering the air for health reasons the claim by the makers of my one is l iow it removes litres of water to create dry air i can t really dispute that because we are moving into winter and i would expect the humidity to go down southern hemisphere i never got more than litres which is more than enough potable water for people manufacturer claim l i would expect this to be under lab or otherwise ideal conditions this is not a crit i am impressed with the product so far test environment durban is a small port city on the east coast of africa within the province of kwa zulu natal kzn in south africa sa only very light industry the air is not polluted air clear visibility good small alto cumulous puffs of cloud sort of nimbus sy at the bottom light stratus iow light overcast with extended patchy sunlight actually a really nice day my altitude above sea level asl m asl and i am km from the surf line well within the humidity zone of the sea all times are local zulu time gmt test to the next day per hours litres test to the next day per hours litres test to the next day per hours litres that s more than enough for people with some water discipline the final test was over the winter solstice when humidity was at its lowest aside records from previous years indicate that january is the most humid and june is the least humid i have noted that low humidity in june usually averages about i m getting values of or lower and i m in a coastal zone some more strangeness for the  archives winter solstice test to the next day per hours litres start temp humidity dehumidifier end temp humidity dehumidifier if this is sustained litres strict water discipline is necessary for people but it is possible i am confident about the organic purity of the water but i can find literature from any credible source regarding heavy metal contamination the evidence is enough to convince me normally that dehumidifier condensate is potable but because i plan to ingest it i want to see all arguments i can find nothing convince me why dehumidifier condensate as potable water is a bad idea

1,fireproofing home exterior one thing that i think i am unprepared for is molotovs being hurled at my house i can hold the fort for weeks just being inside my house but i think one weakness that many houses have is the windows and the eaves no matter how well you ve locked things up you ll have to leave if someone starts your roof on fire right i have a stone house so my walls are safe and i am getting a tin roof as well but what can i do about someone throwing a firebomb at my windows of the wooden eaves and soffets of the house
1,this subreddit has been taken over by cryptolibertarians and inflation alarmists the economy is undeniably fucked but you people need to stop getting your information from used car salesmen who are trying to convince everyone to buy whatever shitty asset they ve put their life savings into the fed lowering interest rates and introducing money into the economy to combat deflationary pressure is not the reason the economy is fucked quantitative easing is not the reason the economy is fucked this subreddit was founded on fundamentally anti capitalist roots and used to be primarily concerned with climate issues and their ramifications i have no idea how it s been hijacked like this and even non libertarian types seem to have been swayed by shitty rhetoric stop posting these fucking shitty fearmongering articles focusing on inflation at least look at the sources these articles are coming from fucking investors and market analysts the exact same people this subreddit is supposed to hate and supposedly did hate only a few months ago when gme was all the rage why the fuck are any of you listening to them is this a fucking ron paul subreddit now do you people think the fed controls the minimum wage i ve even heard some of you say this only started when biden was sworn in are you kidding me do you think he phoned up the fed and told them to print money on day how fucking stupid can this shit get have you considered that maybe the housing market is fucked because boomers treat it like a speculative asset or that maybe food prices are rising because of the labor shortage and supply chain disruptions you know inflation isn t when things are more expensive right
1,radio what to look for a short overview it s post  time and as we all know or should know knowledge is the key to moving forward and the transmission of knowledge can never be a choke point enter the radio here is my short synopsis on what to look for and be aware of concerning radio not an all inclusive list of course but hell ya gotta start somewhere so start looking for radios with microphones know the difference between amateur radios and crap and trust me almost anything else is crap cb radios cb radios work on the meter band mhz ish and they are am sigh there is no greater way to waste your time trying to communicate with someone than using am amplitude modulation on frequencies that our atmosphere and our sun have deemed as crap too well crap most of the time if you see a cb radio and it s your only freakin hope don t hope for much most only run very low power qrp without massive amplifiers and did i mention they are am but if that s all you got then that s all you got listen on you cb just before sunrise the grey line this is the best time for long distance dx comm also too at sunset to a lesser degree we don t have enough time to go into the antennas and amplifiers and atmospheric propagation needed to make cb s work halfway decent shortwave radios shortwave radios sw can become your best friend in the year zero sw radios run on very low power usually volts or so of which you could probably power them up with a voltaic pile or an earth battery most sw radios are designed to receive the long medium and short wave bands of the electromagnetic radio spectrum longwave am radio khz khz lf mediumwave am radio khz khz mf shortwave am radio mhz mhz hf but i thought you said am suckz yeah it does but most sw broadcasts are made in am because an am receiver can be made out of just about anything and that is why sw broadcasts are given in am so poor countries can make receivers out of junk and countries that are run by dictators can t control what people can hear but most modern sw radios have side band capabilities too yeah just a quick word about sideband ssb or single side band basically what you do is you chop the crappy energy wasting overly broadbanded am signal in half and pack all of the energy of an am signal into half or less the package this results in greater performance much greater and less power consumption you have vestigial sidebands lower and upper lsb and usb many sw broadcasts are out there on usb usb is more popular than lsb for no particular reason like armed forces radio uses usb for their broadcasts so a sw radio with ssb capabilities can be amazing and they are cheap not to easy to build it can be done but not super simple like with am receivers and a sw radio with ssb will be able to tune into the person to person comm of amateur radios marine police utility radios marine radios are like cb s in that they are channelized and some look very similar but the marine radios have a distinct advantage first of all they are fm yes thank you lord and they have a little kick to them watts of power most run off of v dc and are built like a brick shit house marine radios are what is called simplex there is much more to marine radio than what you see here but this is what you are likely to run into so yeah simplex simplex just means person to person on the same frequency so redrobin is talking to you on mhz and you are talking back to redrobin on mhz y all are sharing the same frequency which is not always the case with police and utility gas water company radios but we ll get to that later marine radio the one in question here is vhf so they operate on channels from mhz to mhz all over the world but vhf very seldom and i mean like never ever do vhf signals stretch beyond the horizon they can and they do but mostly because of a persons elevation and as we all know light bends around the corner a little bit so too with radio waves marines radios are a good find and are fm so none of this foolishness with am police utility radios are probably gonna be useless you might get lucky but i doubt it here s why police and utility company radios of the time run split they use split frequency pairs through repeaters to give their signals very wide coverage but unless the repeater is up and running they are boat anchors and cord wood unless you can reprogram them you might get lucky and find some with single channel simplex on them but it s not likely let me explain police utility company radios transmit tx on one frequency and receive rx on another and they use whats called a repeater as the interface between so redrobin will tx on mhz and rx on mhz to the repeater site with his radio the signal will go through a duplexer from the antenna way up on a mountain usually the duplexer will take in the tx and rebroadcast the signal on the rx frequency simultaneously with a little help along the way from the repeater controller very nifty and handy when you can get a repeater up and running and keep it running but not so good if you are scavenging for radios the crazy good bad thing about police utility radios is there are thousands of them in wherehouses in every municipality they frickin last forever of them are mil spec std and even if you find one that is old and moldy chances are it ll work power up after years of abuse so what is the solution to this shit sandwich dilemma on one hand you have radios built like brick shit houses but on the other they are damn useless without a fricking repeater find the repeater site that is associated with the radios and power it back up again a lot of the repeaters are built pretty tough too to make your radios comm back and forth this would be ideal reprogram the radio to work simplex person to person just like you think radios to work i talk you talk on the same freq reprogramming cables are just as wide and varied as the frickin radios that are connected to them damnit man and then you have to have the software and the drivers i know right but you might get lucky when you breakinto city hall or the municipal garage and find the radio guy s corner of the room and there it all is angels singing claps of thunder laid out before you are all of the repeater site locations operating frequencies dispatcher locations mountains of radios antennas and coax what you need is selectivity a technical term that basically means right here right now and most importantly a variable frequency oscillator vfo amateur radios ham ham radios combine all of the above into one package you can choose what frequency you want to talk on ham radios are easily modded too because you have a vfo which is a fancy way of saying that your radio has the ability to tune to any frequency you want it to without having to program it or useing channels ham radios cover a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and they can run simplex or duplex on hf frequencies they call this running split you can operate them on different modes like am fm wfm wide fm ssb single side band cw continuous wave or morse code and a thousand different digital modes ham radios generally fall into or groups two meter radios m cm hf and hf radios sdr radios two meter radios m cm m radios are the bread and butter of most ham shacks and pretty much every ham has one or has had one they are single band radios that cover the meter wavelength from mhz to mhz most of these are fm radios designed to work through a repeater hold up but they have vfo s and you can swap easily from duplex to simplex at the push of a button of m radios are fm and the mobile radios run around watts while the handheld versions usually do like watts radios are just like m radios but they use different frequencies mhz to mhz and operate at a higher wavelength cm that s it they are very common and a lot of the time you will find radios that are dual band radios that have just the m and cm bands on them very popular for use in mobile applications hf radios these ham radios cover some of the mf and all of hf radio and usually all or most of the vhf and parts of the uhf radio frequency spectrum so they operate on multiple bands and in different modes if you so desire to cover the most effective long distance dx comms in order to match what is going on in the atmosphere and the sun hf frequencies and the radios that accompany them have the ability to consistently communicate over great and remote distances like russia or japan or l sn i used to talk to a guy before the solar cycle took a shit every night in siberian russia like he was next door mate so some dx frequencies are more effective at night some are more effective in the daylight this has to do with the layers of the ionosphere being more ionized by the sun and less ionization with less sunlight some frequencies are more effective at solar minimum and some are more effective at solar maximum the sun goes through an year cycle from top to bottom of heavy output of radiation and lighter output of radiation so with an hf rig you as a radio man can adapt to what the universe is doing and have the most effective comm some hf rigs have built in digital modes of comm that can pull out very weak signals from the noise software defined radios sdr software defined radios sdr have all the operating abilities that the other ham radios have but with a sdr radio you can see the entire radio spectrum at a glance and use the digital modes with out a computer interface because the radio does this all for you so keep your eyes open for radios when you go back into the cities to scavenge for resources old radios sometimes are the most resilient and can take a lot of damage and still operate also you need to keep in mind how you are going to power up your new found treasure most ham radios run off of vdc around amps or so of current drain hope this helps and i ll feild any questions y all might have p s hurricane irma jose emergency hf nets are currently being held on the following frequencies emergnet net is on mhz day time hours and mhz night satern salvation army team radio network is on mhz midcars the midwest amateur radio service is on

1,and the war came fiction at least as of now this a super well researched story of how the election could lead to a civil war the atlantic article that got a lot of attention earlier today is pretty much a tldr of this story except this story actually plays out a potential scenario that leads to a civil war summary of this scenario spoilers ahead gt the election comes down to pennsylvania which trump appears to have won lt gt turns out russia attacked the voter rolls throwing the result into dispute in our universe just substitute trump appearing to win on election night but mail in ballots putting biden ahead lt gt supreme court rbg is alive in this story ultimately can t settle the dispute lt gt pennsylvania legislature nominates trump electors democratic governor invalidates the electors and takes pennsylvania out of the electoral college lt gt that would have won it for biden but michigan s legislature nominates trump electors even though biden clearly won the state michigan governor can t invalidate the electors because biden needs michigan s electoral votes to win the election controversy over whether michigan legislature can do that because the people of michigan clearly voted for biden lt gt republicans hold the senate ensuring when electoral votes are counted trump wins but house flees dc in their view preventing the senate from officially certifying the results and making it so that speaker pelosi becomes president when trump s term expires lt gt trump and pelosi are both sworn in on inauguration day delaware s congresswoman resigns and biden wins the seat in a special election he s voted as the new speaker pelosi resigns and biden becomes president at least according to the democrats lt gt trump and biden both claim to be president and the military remains neutral there are riots in the streets eventually trump orders biden to be arrested and the ensuing conflict leads to the start of a civil war the story ends there lt the eeriest thing about this story is the author started writing it in before the coronavirus pandemic even happened in his first draft warren was the democratic nominee it would have seemed crazy to think about such scenarios a year ago but now it isn t so crazy anymore

1,a brief comment to anyone who has been wondering at the amount of anti covid vaccine contributors in this sub people have been mentioning in some comment threads how this sub has been seeing increasing amounts of anti covid vaccine rhetoric and i think the reasons for that are pretty simple it is not because nonewnormal has been banned and in fact with the quarantine it seemed to get more subscribers not less in fact there are quite a few vaccine hesitant subreddits and meme subreddits mocking covid and vaccines in general i believe it is really due to the fears anti covid vaccine people have there are all the jokes about g tracking chips what have you and some people might genuinely believe those things but from my experience the vast majority of those who do not want to take the covid vaccine simply worry about potential long term side effects of it the theories of these long term effects range from mild health concerns to full blown infertility and mass heart attacks now if you were able to put yourself in someone else s shoes for a moment and you could imagine yourself as someone who for reasons unjustified or justified genuinely believed that these vaccines will do more harm than good over time potentially fatal and catastrophic harm mind you then naturally you might begin to think about the harm that might do to the fabric of a society  as far as i have gathered is rooted in climate change however it is not only the climate changes that people are concerned about but human responses to them including policy wars famines refugees fleeing increasingly uninhabitable countries and how governments will respond to these refugees supply chains breaking down etc now imagine that you had all of those things going on but also mass outrage at vaccine efficacy decreasing over time regular booster shots vaccine passports and all throughout covid itself scarcely slowing down let alone whether these conspiracy theories actually come true i am not commentating on whether or not vaccine hesitancy is justified or not merely that those who are genuinely afraid of the vaccines will naturally believe that they will contribute to social unrest and  and that s why there s some overlap with this subreddit i hope maybe this can shed some light on the matter and that people can kick back in having a place to discuss  whatever the contributing factors to it may be

1,thanks white people for destroying the earth as an african american who recently began educating himself on the complexities of economics technology and climate change i just want to say thanks thanks for colonizing the world thanks for creating the machinations of destruction and death thanks for establishing this hypocritical governmental system that stole everything called it conquest then expects others to obey laws forbidding the same actions lol thanks for creating wealth with your mostly unnecessary pursuit of inventions then pushing our species to the brink of extinction with your arrogance and sheer greed thanks for creating plastic and allowing it to seep into the every facet of our biology and ecosystem we sure do love all of our cheap chinese trinkets thanks for being the richest most powerful people on the planet and literally doing fuck all to solve the impending global calamities thanks for putting sugar artificial garbage in all of our food and creating the diabetes obesity epidemic that plagues our society thanks for monetizing every kernel of my being thanks for creating a society so discordant with nature she s decided to sanitize us like a bad virus i really wanna express my gratitude because minorities have never had a voice in this power structure to even begin making changes necessary to hopefully save something i don t hate white people nor am i racist but this is the truth i know the majority of you had no control over this but at the same time i can t look at anyone my skin color and blame them for the crisis once again thanks y all

1,how to counter we managed until now all negative predictions were wrong argument when trying to educate people on the problems of overpopulation pollution  in general many people are dismissive and use the argument you are just spreading doom we managed until now we will in the future trying to explain that just because we barely have managed with severe negative trends in the past does not mean that we will continue to do so indefinitely we never faced something like the pension crisis where the old outnumbered the young we never faced this level of drought and pollution we never faced this level of population growth the us never had billion dollars of debt up from just trillion in never before have the big central banks printed the amount of money they printed in the last years just because we managed some problems in the past and just because some predictions of  didnt come true yet doesnt mean that there is nothing to worry about and that we can avoid a reconing forever

1,the recent spate of serological surveys showing high prevalence of covid and thus a lower ifr are junk science there have been quite a few studies that have come out over the past couple of weeks studying the prevalence of antibodies to covid in various regions of germany denmark the us etc that show that lo and behold the prevalence of covid infection is extremely high in the population sometimes up to x more than official case numbers indicate now it is a given that the true caseload is going to be higher than the officially diagnosed figures however these studies are showing that the prevalence is astronomically higher this is being touted as a great thing since it would put the ifr infection fatality rate at extremely low numbers in line with the just a flu bro s wildest dreams at this point these studies are all junk science at this point and should be disregarded why two reasons most have bad sampling biases none of these tests have been independently verified with robust sample sizes and very few have been independently verified at all as an example let s look at the widely touted stanford survey in terms of sampling bias it recruited participants on facebook it s so absurd as to really be in joke territory but that s what they did this almost certainly resulted in an extremely enriched sample of self selected participants who thought they had covid and wanted a test which are still hard to get in the us in terms of test accuracy specificity is important that value determines how good the test is at picking up on sars cov specific antibodies as opposed to other antibodies that may be similar such as the ones for the common cold corona viruses so if a test is specific it will on average give a false positive rate this is key to understand why specificity is so important for these kind of studies to be useful you need to have a very high specificity rate in the range in this study the authors confidence intervals cannot possibly be accounting for false positives correctly that line is from this excellent article is a great takedown of that study generally and goes in depth on both of these problems of course these tests could become meaningful with further research and verification and we hope they do we do need to keep in mind that it took two years to create an accurate serological test for hiv however so sometimes these things can go quite slowly but at this point in the process they are of questionable accuracy and thus their results can do more harm than good as one expert said having many inaccurate tests is worse than having no tests at all this is because right now there is a huge amount of pressure mounting to return to bau and these shoddy unreliable findings give the go ahead to do just that the argument goes if the ifr is equal to or even less than the flu then it s just a high r vale that s been collapsing medical infrastructure and we should already be approaching herd immunity but now we re nearing in on herd immunity so we can let er rip and open everything up again bau here we come it s denialism frankly based on shit science it reminds me a bit of how the ipcc has factored in beccs a fantasy tech that will likely never be scaled up into many of its projections to give a more favorable picture of the situation and let s just say for the sake of argument that these surveys are against all evidence accurate and we are nearing a very high prevalence that does not necessarily imply that herd immunity will be achieved because we don t know how or if immunity will function for this disease it might give durable sterilizing immunity for a year or two or it might give transient non sterilizing immunity for only a few months the infection might clear in of cases or become persistent in some substantial portion of cases antibody dependent enhancement might not happen or it might be common and even if we get the rosiest possible immunity outcome we don t know how many might not die per se but end up with lifelong disability could it be as high as the who need hospitalization or even higher since some mild asymptomatic cases present with what looks like it might be long term lung damage we don t know i wrote a long post with references about this here in any case these serological tests are not our salvation and those clinging onto them for dear life are engaging in a form of denialism  is still a possible outcome from this pandemic it is possible that maybe they will show similar prevalence results once they ve bene properly vetted but i sincerely doubt it for now it s irresponsible at best to be publishing this kind of junk science here s some more links on the topic for further reading for those who prefer video audio overviews chris martensen finally delivered the smackdown i was hoping he d give since this all started percolating a week ago this nature article whose overview is quite comprehensive this new overview that is perhaps more layperson friendly in wired dr christian drosten the world s leading expert on novel coronaviruses saying that he thinks it is too soon for these kinds of tests dr bill rodriguez giving an excellent overview for why it s too soon to take these surveys seriously this is long piece so do a search in page for whether or not to jump to the relevant section more articles i m too lazy to write a blurb about

1,if the end is near what can we do first off let me say that while this sub is sometimes extremely depressing and sobering i love the discussions and data around economic environmental and overall societal  but i m left wondering is there anything we can do to slow it all down i know thinking one person or one household can make a dent is probably very ego centric but i can t help but hope if enough people band together we can have the slightest bit of positive impact so as a society what can we do if anything to slow our bullet train speed towards oblivion personally my partner and i live in a city take mass transit most places though we own a hybrid vehicle compost recycle which i m skeptical about it getting processed in the right forms or at all since we live in a major us city and try to donate to environmental causes we are practically vegan so not really eating anything that goes through a factory farm we want to do more and encourage others to do more as well are there larger steps everyday people can take anything data driven that we can do or are we really just that f ked

1,how to date and find a partner when feeling so hopeless for the future seriously how am i supposed to maintain a good head space and meet the love of my life and start a happy little family or partnership knowing what i know do i just shut off all news and social media and ignore the vast swaths of the earth currently on fire or the many other things shaping up to be the death of us how do i find someone and not just be dumping my pessimistic shit on them even if it s warranted and i m convinced that i m just one of the people smart enough to not be able to ignore the state of things i could be in much worse places in life and i aim to stay grateful in knowing that but it s easy to feel like the work i put into achieving for the sake of having a minimal layer of security in my life is a waste of time when i should be enjoying the last few good years i have left on this planet in reality i sell my own art at music festivals and i m based in san diego part of me feels like i should just stfu and that the gratitude for my current life should truly be enough for my happiness to break through and maintain i definitely have it better than most and have to remind myself of such constantly i ve made it part of my mission to become comfortable with my own death to enjoy the moments between now and then and to help other people achieve a similar state of mind because it s coming for most of us it seems like i ve found a decent way to take these feelings of hopelessness and despair and transform them into something positive but i still feel like it s a conversation no one really wants to have i can t tell people that focusing on partying is the wrong move because maybe they are right there s no amount of energy i can see putting into being worried about the environment that s going to change shit but partying sure can remind you how beautiful life is anyway i think i mostly wanted to vent and bitch and i knew this was the place where people would resonate with my feelings i hope you re all hanging in there and staying grateful when you can there s beauty in the breakdown
1,u s gross national debt likely to rise by around billion in october assuming the debt ceiling is increased we re about to see the mother of all political battles as trump and a republican congress will need to raise the federal debt ceiling by around trillion in order to get past the midterm elections and will somehow have to sell that idea to their conservative base remember what s important about this fight is not that the u s can t continue to borrow it s that unless the ceiling is raised it is legally prevented from doing so if it doesn t happen by early october there will be a default which could trigger the mother of all market crashes given how overinflated stocks are and how dependent they are on continued uninterrupted debt service

1,post humanism to survive  another discussion in another thread got me thinking about this i place great value personally in the strength of science and technological advancement we have neuralink working on their self titled product which may increase human cognitive capacity to solve problems in novel ways we have advances in health science such as mrna injections to create specific machines pair with the experience of computer programming we re already seeing the first bio hackers emerge we already have the first genetically engineered humans alive today when humans harness the capability what s stopping us from increasing our own heat tolerance and cooling ability to surving a rapidly overheating world what s stopping us given the capability from inventing new technologies to not only clean our atmosphere but make optomise it personalised medicine cancer cures near ai level super intelligent humans are capable in our lifetimes but are these things likely would any of these things even be good for us i embrace the idea of post humanism because i wish to be a better living creature i know that having a chip in my brain is not going to stop me from physically feeling and consciously experiencing the world the experience would only increase in quality at least that is my expectation and opinion so my question to you is do you think post humanism will catch on do you think it ll help solve our problems or create new ones what about our current trajectory what would stop this from happening and how could that be avoided

1,let s have fun with  this story was published by smashwords in i don t think it has received the attention it deserves it s all about  with the twist i enjoyed it what do you think 
1,the survival of the human species was depending on sanders i supported bernie sanders back in and again in from my perspective medicare for all and student debt forgiveness were nice things to have but that wasn t why i supported him there was and is only one issue that actually mattered climate change in he said that we need to treat climate change as a wwii level threat that was a nice rhetorical trick but it severely downplayed the catastrophic consequences that we faced in he talked about implementing the green new deal which again would probably be insufficient but was at least a legislative starting point ultimately i don t think that even sanders understood the true scope of what we are up against but any understanding he possessed easily outshines what joe biden and other establishment democrats can offer i am confident that joe biden will make rhetorical appeals to tackling climate change but i have no confidence that he will follow through on any promises he makes that is what the democratic party has been doing for years when approaching the issues talk up proposals while on a policy level offering things like the non binding paris climate accord which is at best far too weak to meet the severity of the crisis and at worst an absolute joke i don t want to oversell sanders on this subject it is unlikely that his policies would have made any headway through even a democratically controlled senate however his ideas at least offered a possibility that we could actually do something with biden there is no chance and by the time he leaves office it will be too late to implement the changes we need the difference in policies we implement now is not between mild impacts and catastrophe but catastrophe and extinction the dnc chose extinction

1,before the what are your predictions for questions start cropping up precise predictions are usually a game of luck especially when made about something as chaotic as society and economics general trends are something that can be estimated especially if there s math and a model involved but actually nailing down specific events are pretty much fantasy to quote myself here a year ago gt any correct predictions will likely be just luck for example i could predict that oil will be more expensive than it is now but if high energy prices cause the economy to tank demand will dry up and the price would fall totally nailed it but of course how could i miss i ve gone back through through the archives to see how previous predictions have gone and it ain t pretty a summary of the good and bad ebola many many posts about the world destroying virus many others pointed out that while the disease is a disaster in third world conditions it couldn t do well in industrialized societies time would tell fukushima oh the hysteria some even recommended heading to the hills with their grab bags before the  of spent fuel pool four wiped out the northern hemisphere and yes fukushima certainly ranks as the second worst nuclear disaster and horrible for japan the northern hemisphere had less to worry about bee extinction yes bee colony deaths are a serious issue i m certified as an apiarist and the  of commercial apiaries is a serious issue facing industrial agriculture unfortunately many took this to mean that all pollinators everywhere were collapsing and that we d be out of food soon nope bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin everyone get some bitcoin currency fetishists plugged the well fictitious currency as a hedge against  a hedge against government expropriation of your savings or as hedge against fiat currency for most however it just looked like speculation in a faddish invisible commodity conspiracy a significant number of r rs seem to be r conspiritards as well so lots and lots of oddball predictions that involve favorite conspiracy theories us fema doing sinister stuff us homeland security preparing for the clampdown and various us government agencies buying up all the bullets either to kill people or to keep them out of the hands of patriots my son buys stock in ammunition companies as soon as he sees a lot of these posts and sells them a couple of weeks later good way to make a few bucks it s also noteworthy that the top post in r  is this one explaining the reasons for quitting the subreddit it makes me think that despite all the crazy noise here the majority are serious analysts disinterested in conspiracy theories and prepping it keeps me here and keeps me interested nailed it having pissed off everyone by mocking their favorite cause or by not including the one catastrophe actually underway that they think is a scientific conspiracy here are a few noteworthy predictions or comments joebfront predicted a year ago gt cuban trade embargo will end hillsfar got a few right in his shotgun approach last year but some clunkers as well like stable oil prices gt edward snowden will likely get his one year asylum in russia extended gt the syrian conflict will continue bashar al assad will remain in power over his parts gt japan will likely be able to hold on to the value of the yen for another year or several despite massive debts and money printing and an aging populace china will stay the course or try to but real estate prices will drop faster along with economic growth howtospeak may have nailed it with this cryptic comment depending on meaning and whether production falls in gt will be the first waves of the final oil shocks meaning that late is going to be interesting previously made predictions have you found past predictions of note made on this subreddit let s see them i ll add them to the list also let s avoid specific awful predictions no need to embarrass individuals

1,i think most of you will be fine climate change is problematic i will agree on this however it has to be placed in perspective even the ipcc agrees that based on the best evidence we will see global food productivity increase up until degree celsius what has people worried rightly so if the sustainability of our present methods of agricultural food production after climate change we know that climate change lead to changes in balance and interaction between plants and pests that s where you re going to see big changes that will require different forms of food production above three degrees celsius it s obvious that we would have a big problem but i see no reason to believe we will ever manage to sustain temperature three degrees above the pre industrial average gail tverberg looked at it and concluded that our oil limits are most likely to force us to a rcp scenario which in practice implies that global temperatures rise by about degree celsius now if the pencil necked stem nerds who made this disaster possible in the first place have their way and figure out a method to extract fossil fuels that are presently economically not exploitable we would have a far bigger problem but it looks to me as if they re simply hitting physical limits it has to be noted that temperature increases are unevenly distributed the nature of the greenhouse effect causes most of the increase to occur at night and winters to increase in temperature more than summers this means in practice that annual mean maximum temperatures have increased by degrees while annual mean minimum temperatures have increased by degree celsius this is why i m somewhat skeptical of the horror scenarios i see where people fear seeing their local temperatures vary from degrees celsius to degree celsius within a few years but what about the methane clathrate catastrophe in the arctic well much of the temperature rise in the arctic can be attributed to the effects of black carbon emissions from china which change the albedo of the arctic sea ice hansen and others think this is a very underestimated factor the point is that as soon as those coal plants in china shut down the black carbon emissions stop which means that the arctic ice begins to recover which means that temperatures over there go down again black carbon stays only temporarily in the environment unlike co which stays there for centuries it should also be noted that black carbon s temperature effects do seem to have a less normalizing effect on global temperatures as black carbon is not a greenhouse gas but rather a factor that changes albedo as i said our present method of food production is going to become unsustainable isn t that going to lead to mass death i don t really consider that likely after all we ve got quite a bit of spare capacity when it comes to food production for example we throw anywhere between to of our food away in addition we have the stupid habit of transforming corn into ethanol just all the corn grown in the us used for ethanol is enough to feed million people when food prices start to rise you can be quite sure that this ignorant policy is going to come to an end in addition consider that we currently use about a third of arable land to grow crops that are fed to our farm animals those are calories that are fed to people who currently receive far too many calories in their diet the rising costs of meat are simply going to bring those policies to an end we ve got quite some spare capacity unless oil supply is going to drop by an insane a year or something along those lines i honestly don t see why we can t transition to using those resources in a sustainable manner it should be noted that the present system of industrial monoculture didn t become popular because it is the most land efficient use of food production it became popular because it requires the least human labor which thereby massively raised profits unfortunately i lost the source for this but i remember reading that old growth forests can store up to times more carbon than a similar sized field of grain this is not completely analogous to productivity for humans but it shows that abandoning agriculture doesn t have to lead to a disaster when i walk outside over destroyed soils i personally notice that these recovering soils grow a far more diverse palette of plants than they did when i was a child when they would grow very little other than grass this is largely due to the effects of co fertilization we ll learn to adapt there s no reason why you can t grow fresh water mussels in a stream and eat them other than the fact that this does not appear as food to us currently the zebra mussels in the united states are an invasive species but they re perfectly edible but people are scared away from eating them similarly weeds weed is an offensive slur against plants that we should avoid using like amaranth that now live in the fields of crops we grow are actually also perfectly edible and often more healthy than the food we currently eat it s fun to note that in the middle of february i could successfully go out and gather mushrooms in the evening while people older than me assumed that i would not find any because they grew up in a different climate productivity is longer now than it used to be in many places the only places that have me very worried are africa and the middle east africa would suffer most from an increase in maximum temperatures africa is also very vulnerable to soil erosion however even in africa there are some signs that give rise to optimism satellite imagery shows that the co fertilization effect has actually caused the sahel to start greening because plants transfer humidity this is an example of a beneficial positive feedback loop where an increase in plants enables a further increase in plants because of the humidity caused by evapotranspiration many of the problems found in africa can actually be attributed to the use of agricultural methods the green revolution that are really not suitable for african soils in the case of the middle east it should be noted that the gulf states have millions of people living there as migrants who could easily return home
1,recruiting for a sustainable community a year ago i went through complete climate despair realising the depth of the situation and what it means for the future i left england lived in tokyo rio and rural france being informed by locals in each place how strange the local climate was getting extreme heat rain wind etc i found a community in north west italy near the swiss boarder and in the last three months here i have learnt how to build stone walls basic carpentry plastering with traditional materials renovation of classic stoves seasonal crop growing the list goes on i have everything i need and more and have never been happier we have food and water and are protected by the mountains which provide not only a safe but a stunning place to live there are communities here started in the s one is a buddhist retreat basically just a buissness selling cheap enlightenment one is a privately run and owned community with hindu and south america spiritual practice and one a completely wild and free village abandoned in the s going from some inhabitants to maybe the permanent residence of these places are in their s mainly from germany switzerland and elsewhere in europe many are the last few hippies that escaped modern day slavery to find freedom but they are tired run down by their dreams never coming to fruition but things are changing me and others see the potential here that this place and others like it in the mountains will become bastions for people fleeing the chaos of the dying world war and fire may wipe them from the map one day but this is where i choose to make a stand and build a real life permiculture anti capitalism acceptance of all races faiths and creeds that is what we can offer we need the young the old the skilled and unskilled we need anyone who has the courage to leave a world with no future for a valley with infinite potential message me for further details or keep browsing reddit till the fire is at your door your choice
1,done with dems everyone knows the republicans are just the ideological party of economy first environment never but lately i ve tried explaining the dems are by and large part of the problem too after the bernie fiasco and a dozen other headaches i don t have the heart to vote for them any more than the republicans anyone care to explain why i should go blue or better yet provide some sourcing why the dems are as irreversibly flawed as the right for anyone asking how this is  related i think our party system is irreversibly tied to the lack of progress towards achieving any sort of lasting sustainability with the biosphere neither side seems willing or able to fix the problems at hand and i m sick and tired of the left holding the beacon on hope while taking no steps to implement it

1,i am not sure that people actually realize that living off the land without farming is not possible it has not been in some places starting years ago if you look at all the evidence once people started farming they were less healthy ate worse and worked harder hunting and gathering was always preferable to farming people started farming out of necessity we have destroyed so much of the earth and reduced its carrying capacity that it could not support the number of people that it could have years ago considering that we changed to farming then we can assume that we were hitting the limits of living off the land in certain places then farming was taken up all over the world about the same time with the estimate of million people on earth at that time that may have been as many people as our planet could hold by us living off the land what would the carrying capacity be now of what it was what will it be in years without environmental destruction earth could hold out of people alive today with the environmental destruction it can handle about in people alive today if people ever tried we would end up like the st matthew island reindeer we would start out so far above carrying capacity that we would completely  the ecosystem edit sources agriculture was worse at first basis for the assumption that farming was not the preferred method at first environmental degradation might be the reason we moved to farming population at the start of agriculture range of estimates is from about to million me living off the land without farming is not possible comments that is stupid we can farm me
1,australia power trapped a modern predicament the link and the short interviews illustrate a fascinating problem the world is starting to face recently australia installed a tesla battery to keep the power grid running when renewables aren t able to add enough load they provide power to top up but at incredible prices this has the effect of all non essential uses being shut down that might sound like it makes sense but during a heat wave this might mean shutting off air conditioners or don t eat for a month the interviews talk about industry shutting down and how this is not possible to do for more than a couple hours in some cases and still be viable okay so they are now stuck really stuck the population and the economy has now hit most likely its peak power usage and the power stations can t keep up coal power is now taboo but solar and batteries are not reliable enough under enough circumstances the ramifications are significant and eerie
1,the fall of the shogunate this is kind of the real story in gail tverberg s our finite world don stewart tried to portray the edo japan as some kind of sustainable society citing a book from an english chap named azby brown i destroyed his argument by citing the famines of that country azby brown an architecture professor can t read classical japanese which is the language the actual accounts are written and his book is full of fictional incidents which had nothing to do with reality in short it is what azby brown had decided feudal japan should be not something based on reality i wouldn t use azby brown s book for anything but because don is quite powerful in that site i was banned that s ok now when i was arguing with don i was not aware of imamura shohei although he had produced the remake of nariyama bushiko a movie famous for portraying a resource poor society i recently became aware of another imamura film called eijanaika which means whatever anything goes so what that film is fiction but the eijanaika movement did exist actually it occurred on one year before the shogunate fell somewhat like a millenarian movement its chief feature was that the people mostly poor just grouped and began to dance the hell out of it they got naked and performed sexual like acrobatics in the middle of streets and squares the phrase eijanaika more like ee ja nai ka anything goes was the mantra they would dance shouting that phrase this movement occurred when  was going on government service had stopped and magistrates were more interested on saving their own skin than provide basic care food and everything else were getting scarce due to unrest in the country this movement which nobody bothered to document until imamura made the movie based upon this was a typical manifestation of  in imamura s movie documenting the lives of lowlives in edo during the waning days of the shogunate after driven to the edge the people revolt by dancing violently in the end they dance all the way to the shogun s palace where all of them are killed by maxim guns that might have been a device to end the movie which does not really have a plot but more like a series of incidents to describe the  but in real history this movement suddenly disappeared with no reason as well and their existence itself was forgotten until this movie made on imamura shohei made a lot of movies about postwar japan about the downtrodden following the  of their world and usually the fate of the characters are tragic although they are unvanquished till the bitter end in real history after the shogunate fell lots of peasant revolts occurred all of them were eventually suppressed with lots of bloodshed by the new restoration government whose leaders tended to be to lower ranking members of the old shogunate a  tends to well flush down millions of disenfranchised people into the toilet that is the reality

1,my fellow americans now here we stand on the brink of a global economic  a global pandemic the likes humanity hasn t seen for over a century and on top of all that climate disasters that are practically past a point of no return and the best this country has to offer is joe fucking biden while he loses his shit in front of us more and more each day chosen simply because hell keep status quo and was the token white guy next to obama for a few years and then they expect us to simply sit by and watch this mockery of our so called democracy and even expect us to assist him in this victory of yet again the lesser of two evils no fuck this shit we dont have time to wait more fucking years for mediocre bullshit while the corporate shitheads and billionaire assholes bleed us dry for the last few years we all have before  give us liberty or give us fucking death we have a goddamn right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness and i dont know about you all but i dont see a whole lot of that happening for the typical american anymore as were forced to pay more than anyone for basic healthcare are extorted for simply the attempt at obtaining an education which leads us to being enslaved by working multiple jobs that dont even pay a high enough wage to buy food a roof over your head or enough for the next generation to even dream of raising a family of their own enslaved by those who have everything already simply by being born into wealth or from exploiting us their fellow americans or other countries for nothing but material gains as they sit protected by the pathetic excuse that is capitalism well the constitution doesnt say a god damn thing about preserving greed profits or capitalism now does it we need to tear down anything that stands in opposition to the betterment of our people no matter who they pretend to be we will not pay to be alive we will not beg to be heard when it is we the people who are in charge of our government and our country i think it s about time the people in charge learned what america was supposed to be founded for and i damn well guarentee you it wasnt to make a goddamn profit by the blood of our fellow countrymen if the powers that be do everything in their power to stop us from getting the bare fucking essentials and steal what s rightly ours just so they can keep their grossly overgrown piles of wealth and profit margins just for the sake of profit margins then it s time we rise up together and put the fear back where it belongs in those foolish enough to call themselves our leaders or our government when they serve only themselves or those with power this country was made with the express purpose of equality and freedom of the people and we will no longer be slaves to those which whom we give power if they dont submit to the will of the people then we make them by any means necessary just like the men who founded this country intended and designed it for and like them if we must to fight and die for we tried things their way and it fails us time and time again we play by rules that they have never followed now its time they pay for their crimes against the american people and the exploited people around the world for we are out of time my friends now will we go out with a whimper or a motherfucking battlecry the choice is ours and no one elses no matter what any pundit politican or power worshiping whores would have you believe our time is now and our time is quickly running out it s the time for action it s time for the new way of life its time for a renewed america a renewed love for each other not money or power the only division we can sustain is the division of those who have the wealth and power and we demand it given back amongst us we the people who rightfully deserve and created said wealth and power we the people who make this country run we the people who have actually worked hard our whole lives and still see next to nothing for it as we all realize too late that the american dream has become a dystopian nightmare that was never designed to be achieved by the likes of the working class let s rip them back down to earth and let them feel all the pain suffering and devastation of a fall from such inappropriate heights the pain of generations held in shackles for their selfish limitless gains let them feel what its like to beg for life like they seem so content on allowing everyone else to feel as long as everything keeps moving for them for that is status quo and we will not allow this to continue anymore
1,are there any plans to preserve human knowledge to survive the  like nuclear semiotics but for climate  what i m picturing is some network of satellites that stores the data and transmits it to earth but in order to make sure humans will be able to access it there will also be tablets loaded unto drones on some satellites the drones will re enter the atmosphere and drop their payloads of tablets to the survivors we should still fight to make the  less hellish but i d love if there was a back up plan

1,how do you avoid being a doomer climate change is desertifying the world and creating obscene and deadly abnormal weather c is at insane levels and ripping holes in the atmosphere a giant solar flare could wipe out electronics and erase all your dogecoin ocean life is doomed plastics and environmental estrogens are accumulating blackrock is buying up all the houses to hedge against potential hyperinflation of the dollar gas is insane groceries are insane politicians and the wealthy are unethical and corrupt and lining their pockets with money while laughing at you and inflating prices and attaching fees to just about everything besides air the fish whales elephants bears dolphins monkeys insects are fucked and theres far more happening that no one has time to understand because of the pace and decentralized nature of modern society i don t want much of anything i just want to save for a few years and get a small house in the southwest work a couple days a week to keep the lights on and read books in the shade i feel its very reasonable and attainable but then i read this sub and just find myself asking if there is enough time or what the point even is how much of this is real and how much of this is us using this board as an echo chamber how do you avoid the nihilist pit of despair while having all of this scholarly scientific data showing with ever increasing precision just how fucked everything is
1,the sci fi novel nature s end predicted exactly how the california wildfires would behave in in sci fi writers whitley strieber amp james kunetka published a novel named nature s end the book predicts a st century in which the natural environment in an overcrowded but more technically advanced earth was reaching a dangerous tipping point amp xb the book takes in the year and early on there is a harrowing scene in which two characters who live just outside los angeles gets trapped in their home when their entire community and the whole mountaintop that surrounds it almost instantly goes up in flames and they have to make a harrowing escape the way the scene is written is so close to the survivor accounts of fleeing the camp fire it s spooky amp xb the novel doesn t get everything right by a long shot global warming was not well understood in those days some of the nature breakdown scenarios are pretty far fetched and the main plotline where the heroes rush around the globe trying to prevent a mass global suicide lottery is pretty hokey i just hope that a later chapter in the book about the final conflagration that destroys most of the remaining amazon forests doesn t also come true sometime soon

1,rather than benefiting the environment large scale tree planting can sometimes do the opposite two new studies have found one paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions a separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated takeaway it s complicated every country every tree plot has its own issues be careful of back of the envelope calculations with that said some tree plantations are also outrageously good for the environment ultimately the best are native forests not cut down
1,analysts predicts trump will appear to win in an electoral landslide on the night of the election only to lose the election days possibly weeks later when all votes are finally tallied this short interview discusses the increasingly likely scenario that on the night of the election it will appear that trump has won a landslide victory most republicans will vote the day of the election and their votes will be reflected in the tally within hours a large portion of democrats will vote by mail and their votes may not be counted for days or even weeks after election night there are so many ways this could end in outright violence and potentially be litigated well in january

1,will there be a point when the united states is deemed legitimately dangerous to the rest of the world would the world try to save us from ourselves i ve had this thought for a while but at what point will we truly be deemed the bad guys and at the point will there be some sort of intervention it s clear that here in the us half of the country does not agree whatsoever with this administration or most of its decisions if there was an invading force i certainly wouldn t do anything to stop them not that i really could do anything if they weren t attacking or killing innocent civilians to me this administration is already a global threat considering how unstable it has made the us and how integral the us is to rest of the world what do you think it would take to intervene is it even possible

1,the beginning of the end it s a shame this the beginning of the end all started in the country i call home the uk this country nowadays is an environmental shithole we have killed off pretty much all of our large mammals chopped down pretty much every ancient forest dedicated almost of our land surface area to agriculture and pretty much ruined the rest and for what so we can travel across the atlantic to go do some totally unnecessary task eat a fat juicy steak every other week or drive in our oversized tin cans to go do some other pointless shit what has this industrial civilisation actually given us i would actually extend that to what has any civilisation given us in my eye all we have gained are pointless material assets which when it comes down to it we have no use for and in the process of doing this we have fucked the entire planet probably for millions of years to come human extinction is looking more and more to be the most likely outcome although maybe some of us deserve it we ve seen this destruction coming for years but we the humans of planet earth were just too busy chasing more and more material affluence amp xb i just hope that if we survive we learn to go back to our nature amp xb i totally appreciate that the majority of the human race has just been dragged along by this however most namely the white colonialist dick heads from europe and now the ridiculously wealthy capitalist class have fucked us and still are i feel the most sorry for those poor people have been practically enslaved so we rich westerners can have our over indulgent lifestyles which we now mainly live in the electronic world they have nothing to fucking do with this shit but they are gonna be the first to feel it or already are sorry for the rant just had to get it out
1,how fast will  be forests vs food we only have about of north america s original forests left we destroy some million acres of forest on earth every year we already slashed and burned half the rainforests on earth rainforest soil is of poor quality and quantity so farming it only degrades it even faster rainforest roots are so dense they don t require robust and plentiful soils but why is this so important to how fast  will be the answer lies straight ahead in the ipcc told us emissions must peak by to stay within c of warming in the ipcc told us emissions must peak by to stay within c of warming the ipcc says we can make this change because of what they call negative emissions bio energy meaning we will get energy by consuming plant matter so it pulls more co out of the air than it emits for which by the way no such technology exists and the kicker is they say that we will need billion acres of new farmland to do it that much farmland is about the size of india which is equal to nearly of all the arable land on earth the acronym for this fantasy is beccs bio energy carbon capture amp storage the real acronym is bs bull shit where do you think we ll find all this new farmland the rainforests world hunger will guarantee it why read on in years human agriculture will ground to a stop because of soil loss and degradation of china s soil and of its groundwater is already unsafe we are right now already slashing and burning brazil s rainforests just to feed china s pigs china s pigs already eat of the soy grown in south america the chinese are buying up farmland all over the earth because we add million people to earth every days who would very much like to eat over the next years we will have to grow more food over the next years than we grew in all of the last years combined this is called math get used to it it will rule your life we already converted nearly half the earth s surface into cities and farmland do you seriously believe billion people will stop eating meat and wasting food to feed nine billion people all at once for all their lives means we will need million acres of brand new farmland every year for years instead we are losing million acres of farmland every year we are losing soil at twice the rate we need to grow it just to be able to eat never mind the additional requirements of beccs we will soon run out of easy access to critical fertilizers which are irreplaceable cannot be manufactured by humans and for which there are no substitutes in years billion people will be without enough water in years billion people will be severely short of water ground water depletion has gone critical in major agricultural centers worldwide the world s rivers and lakes are drying up drought is spreading across the earth try growing food for billion people without water and soil we kill elephants and orangutans before slashing and burning indonesia s remaining rainforests just to grow palm oil that is burned in northern europe s german cars we call this the green economy on account of how green people are behind the ears when it comes to their e con omy two degrees of global warming is not safe it s crazy james hansen all ipcc projections totally ignore accelerated methane emissions in years we will pass peak energy and minerals this will happen when all our new solar panels and wind mills stop working and become expensive junk we can t afford to replace or recycle in times of shortages in water food energy minerals and civility recycling their component alloys costs more and uses more energy than mining for them does green jobs without the pension over the next years energy demand will double at the same time we have to reduce emissions at least because over billion rural refugees will move to cities and of the infrastructure they require does not even exist yet already china has poured more concrete in the last few years than the u s a has in all of the last years concrete production is a super emitter of carbon into the air yet it also takes times the amount of rated renewable energy to close one equally rated fossil fuel plant simply because renewable energy is intermittent and fossil energy is not it will be a physical impossibility to meet all future demand with renewable energy and reduce emissions all at the same time half the renewable power in europe comes from burning imported wood from all over the world m i t predicts world economic  in years lloyd s of london predicts the end of civilization in years but don t you worry your pretty little head about any of this because there s always our backup planet

1,the complete triumph of capital over labor there is no more reason to placate the masses what many people miss is that the classic factor of production land capital and labor has d automation has made labor unnecessary and it is just land and capital or land capital and technology people have ceased to matter without firepower they are hapless to resist with labor no longer necessary since machines and web based solutions do all the work laborers are no longer necessary as well all the good locations having bought out by those with access to cheap capital the masses will be driven to shantytowns safely out of the zones where the beautiful people live the rules of game have changed those who harness capital live those who don t die some lucky people by the accident of birth or by luck who ended up with some choice bits of real estate will hunker down with what they have knowing there won t be another all labor laws including workers comp or the prohibition of stiffing wages will disappear since the laborers have lost their political power instead of a general  it will suddenly look like south america of the old days with ranches bigger than many european nations and owners living better than kings complete with very poor laborers who can be killed by the whim of the foreman usually a relative of the owner people might call it  that is probably going to be true no more mass consumption no more prosperity no more higher standard of living instead people will be owned by the capital institutions or the owner of the land where they build their shacks and like the old days when only those who owned property was able to vote democracy disappears and will be replaced by something like the old roman senate the century of nicer living for the ordinary people having ended  and technical innovation which will reach the stars will go hand in hand as shown in north korea which has both ox driven carts and space satellites

1,how deteriorating climate might affect politics in coming years this sub is not meant to be political and i hope this post is not taken as a political statement of course i have my own views but i do not intend to bash on any political positions mostly referring to the us think what you will about the current dramas around immigration abortion laws same sex marriage taxes whatever i m going to make some predictions based on what i ve seen amp read and not intended to take a stance on any of those issues one of two things is likely to happen in the next several years including the election republicans massively screw themselves their ongoing narrative of being tough on terrorism and immigration continues to appeal to their shrinking aging base while large segments of the population who are increasingly exposed to climate induced disruption and food price shocks start voting blue out of perceived self interest consider even business is getting behind taking action on climate change also if it turns out that the current effort to overturn roe v wade is in some way successful that will contribute greatly to taking a lot of wind out of the republican sails because that issue has been a major energizer for their base for decades and an overturn would simultaneously energize the left which we are seeing already note i m not taking a stance on this issue in this post just commenting on what effect current events could have on voting patterns an overturn plus climate trauma could deal a one two crushing blow to republican power for many years to come republicans pivot and start adopting a stance favoring preserving the environment while retaining their other positions i m not entirely sure what a green republican platform would be like but i could imagine it happening if some of their large corporate donors find ways to dominate and monetize green initiatives which would probably include renewable energy and green construction such a platform would likely also include large adaptation subsidies and infrastructure projects which would benefit the rural conservative base think on this it appears very likely that climate change will be a major driving factor for democrats in the election cycle what better way to deflate that than by pivoting to agree and depoliticize on climate issues while continuing to support the rest of the conservative agenda amp xb what do you think

1,no long term big projects in the horizon  might be irreversible with the  of international travel and the uncertainties long term planning is kind of impossible which means no more big projects in the horizon amp xb all the governments now do is throw helicopter money which maintains the current level but does not really make the economy go anywhere amp xb existing infrastructures will not be maintained and the replacements will not be forthcoming so easily since an outbreak can stop a project for an indefinite time and no one wants such risk in today s economy amp xb contrary to popular belief recovery from the black death was kind of slow all of europe was in depression from to about when slaves and other stuff from africa began to be imported to there thanks to henrique the navigator the portuguese prince whose contribution to western civilization is not well known in the english speaking world it was he who first thought about going to other continents to expand the west s reach but now there are no more continents to be discovered it is going to be space or bust amp xb at that time ships could be built with wood but we can t go to space via wood based ships amp xb with large scale projects no more possible i think there will be a kind of fast meltdown of infrastructure as the existing ones are not maintained mankind might indeed retreat to the tech level of about quite fast

1,when did you first see a possible  why do you get the data and science behind the limitations to endless growth yet equally smart people you know don t it s hard to be objective about the state of play of the planet and i try to read a variety of news and popular science sources to try and avoid confirmation bias but i keep coming back to the same conclusion as everyone on this sub reddit given that there are only k or so people here and we still seem to be a minority in your average western democracy i m curious about when did you first became convinced that we re heading towards disaster where would others place you on the optimist pessimist personality spectrum and how is that changing what helped you finally get where we re heading a single moment individual article or documentary or have you been more influenced by family community values or perhaps having seen first hand a large slum oil spill or other such disaster are you somewhat resigned to a  or are you doing something to help avoid it in however a small way are you seeing the people you re in direct contact with work family etc change their views to any great extent what s the hardest topic of the many wrapped up in  to bring up in polite company eg limits to population any scientists or researchers here in any related disciplines finding that you re being muzzled by your governments or by anonymous cowards using death threats etc just thought i d ask
1,those of us without the funding to consider disowning our own humanity have much better options available to us cont d we don t have to use technology in such antisocial atomizing ways we can become the individual consumers and profiles that our devices and platforms want us to be or we can remember that the truly evolved human doesn t go it alone being human is not about individual survival or escape it s a team sport whatever future humans have it will be together douglas rushkoff
1,the confusion of everything i think that one of the main reasons why world is heading towards  is that everything has become so complex and confusing that nobody actually understand things anymore things just happen and nobody knows really what to do instead of using reason people make up simple stories about the reality prime example is trump and qanon everything bad happens because there is a huge evil conspiracy world is collapsing because it s somehow the plan of some bad people but that is not simply the thinking of the right left does it also by blaming everything on billionaires and capitalism almost everybody has some sort of personal story about good and evil socialism anarchism fascism nazism and all the other ideologies are only based on patterns people want to see in world centrist ideas are also pure fiction and wishful thinking politicians have become nothing more than helpless puppets of market forces politicians don t rule they manage they try to create propaganda which justifies the excesses of capitalism to the people if there is massive income differences and poverty a neoliberal politician comes and tells how it is all good also politicians create the illusion that somebody is in control but people are starting to lose their faith in that nobody believes in politicians only politicians with any sort of credibility are the populists because they look strong but even they don t have control when the normal society is now collapsing because of covid there is nothing left to believe in they only thing left is the hyperreality as in adam curtis documentary hypernormalisation a total nihilism steps in and the only thing left is some sort of hedonism based on fake reality eventually even that fades away and we are left with nothing simply a world without direction or reason and at the same time climate change extinctions and pandemics are destroying the very foundations of society it s a total chaos in which nobody knows what to do or think

1,is it worth it to keep a k predictions for the world in the s i will hit years old in thats typically the age where people retire right i ve been working a low paying office job with no upward mobility for the last couple years but its a pretty good gig for a degree less college flunkout they even have a small k matching program i have a few thousand in there right now earlier this year i decreased my contribution to just every biweekly paycheck my logic was why not just have the money now cause what are the realistic chances of me ever seeing that money at plus im most likely only going to be at that job a few more years its sort of a dying business so do you think i m right that people my age early to mid s will never end up seeing that retirement money i know a lot of people my age murmur about social security running out long before we will ever see it will the american empire even be around in the form it is today is a long fucking time to go without a major war especially as resources dwindle water wars energy grid overloads and environmental conditions deteriorate honestly i cant wrap my head around the idea of things being at all normal in the s then again its the same amount of time to the s and the s wasn t that different than today but then again things are ramping up so what do you think is early enough from total  that there will be room for a normal middle class retirement what predictions do we have for the s i just saw some article on this sub about the amazon forest being gone by then def a boe by then
1,uk chief scientific adviser vallance says of people being admitted to hospital with covid have had two doses of the vaccine stock markets around the world are dropping feels like march again people are waking up to the fact delta virus is no joke vaccines may be bypassed or power waning nobody seems to know but cases in highly vaccinated nations are skyrocketing when true fear sets in and the  begins i expect food shelves to be empty just like toilet paper last time the stock market is higher than it has been in all of history biden at a press conference today he seems like an old and broken man ignorance arrogance and denial have led humanity to this fate climate change will only accelerate after the financial  as the means to progress will be destroyed i hope and pray that i am wrong may god help us all
1,if you had to pick tiny island flinders kangaroo or king or tasmania we re currently in mainland australia my husband and will be in a position to buy acres a cabin to put on it and solar water harvesting systems to put on that relatively soon we have children and therefore care to pick a spot that will be viable a generation or after our deaths i realise that many here don t feel thats even possible but i have to hope for the best a small agricultural island feels like it would be relatively safer longer provided the spot was above predicted sea level rise but in a peak oil type senerio it may become impossible to leave which is bad if the main land has medical supplies that can t be accessed but if the main land is equally worse off the isolation might be a plus tasmania might be a compromise as it s quite large compared to the other people on the small islands in tas and it s growing unsustainably atm and more support may be available wish i could predict the future if you had the choice which would you do

1,eventually things will break down i am a graduate architecture and urban planning student and in my opinion in the case of a global systemic  where power grids fail infrastructure crumbles and utilities cease one can indeed survive quite pleasantly in a modern sustainable resilient house i even think pockets of civilization might prosper surviving in sustainable resilient cities we can power ourselves feed ourselves get clean water the technology is there in some places it is even already implemented bud i do think it would come to an end eventually my reasoning complex manufacturing chains and tell me if i am wrong here but today there is basically nothing more complicated than a pencil that wouldn t be manufactured across the globe mining rare materials in africa manufacturing parts in germany assembling microchips in taiwan putting finished product together in china a singly city hell even a single country today are completely dependent on the global capitalist manufacturing chains and once severed they would loose the capacity to produce many things even if you are a billionaire and think you can make your own micronation ecosystem with all your rich buddies you can t replace those supply chains eventually things would break down i guess what i am saying is either we save all of us or nobody will endure for long
1,are humans unable to imagine a world where covid doesnt go away i work for an investment firm in commercial real estate and in our internal planning meetings the baseline assumption is always that covid will go away in x months because of the vaccine this assumption hasn t changed since last march it was always once we have vaccine in x months everything will be back to normal and we will just wait for things to get better i ve always been a skeptic of this assumption it s like the entire leadership in the company is just hoping things will get better instead of planning for the very likely chance that covid will never go away are humans innately unable to imagine a scenario where covid never goes away or are people just blissfully ignorant on hopium day by day it is becoming clearer that vaccines are not the silver bullet that we expected
1, can be avoided at least theoretically it can be avoided it would take all of the most powerful nations on earth get together and reach a total binding agreement from there they would launch an effort that would need to be far greater than that of ww which is always cited as the gold standard for united efforts we would need to simultaneously combat climate change and inequality we would have to see such a massive sea change in lifestyles among all classes of people elites would have to give up control and wealth everyone would have to sacrifice something but to imagine such an effort against an invisible enemy and one that is not even understood or agreed upon in terms of a definition this is almost unimaginable
1,climate change deniers how do you guys keep your sanity while talking to these people their points of evidence just blows me away there is no reasoning with them explaining to me that an abundance of co is what plants crave do they realize that once the plant dies the co contained within them is release back up do they know that to offset the co released by just the united states alone would require billion trees planted every year co stays in the atmosphere for many centuries and the only way to really get rid of it is through other geological processes that bury it deep within earth telling me that the hottest recorded year was in the s therefore that makes the current trend of record breaking heat every year for the past years irrelevant that their is a co lag behind hotter weather so then their is no direct correlation that somehow the co should affect the weather instantaneously that their part of the world is colder than ever therefore the world is getting colder as a whole permafrost is already melting with what was suppose to take effect years from now i m told from them it is just another natural cycle that humanity has survive harsher things for thousands of years sure we may survive but you and your family will suffer and may die through the process now i am hearing from them that it is a political agenda to destroy capitalism with scientist being paid exorbitant amounts of money if i mention the total biomass destruction we brought to plants insects and animals some nearing biomass loss i m told that it hasn t affected humanity negatively so the trend can continue without consideration the seriously make me question my sanity
1,fukushima nuclear meltdowns greatest event in history the fukushima cover up greatest crimes in all human history nuclear war taking place right now kevin blanch one of my personal has covered this since day one i m so tired of everyone talking about fucking carbon what s happening is not carbon it s man made ionizing radiation that s killing everything pouring in the pacific ocean it s killed the tide pools bleached the coral destroyed the plankton causing the ocean to free fall  big fish eat little fish all the salmon orcas whales starving to death all these fires and forest burning happening all over the world it s the radiation in the air why is this never mentioned why are there only two people on earth talking about it kevin blanch dana dunford fukushima denial will kill us all it s to late clock struck midnight many years ago nuclear meltdowns are forever there is no known technology to clean this up or stop it but hey cut your carbon geez what a nightmare is this the twilight zone
1,is there a silver lining to  human depravity and corruption racism sexism religious extremism environmental degradation etc are all very depressing it makes me realize that humanity is simply not capable of solving basic problems we cannot get along and we cannot protect the environment in which we live the struggle with trying to control what you cannot control can negatively affect your mental health but i spent the last few weeks on holidays i had a great time i climbed mountains and snorkled in quiet moments i thought about the state of the world and wondered whether there is a silver lining whether there is any positive in  for one there is retribution i am an atheist but just as god condemned humanity to a flood after it sinned so too the upcoming mushroom cloud and environemental destruction is the flood that will exact retribution upon humanity and so in a way there is a sense of justice in it all furthermore because time is limited before we are all victims to a hyperdystopic technocapitalist society there is an urgency now to live life while you can we do not know when  will hit us hard it may be a gradual decline as global warming and wealth inequality erodes humanity slowly but the bottom line is that the decline is happening and it is only getting worse and as such we must live our lives to the fullest while we can forget about having children because your descendents will be obliterated in one or two generations save up the money and embark on perpetual travel instead see all the unique cultures and natural beauty of the world before it all wiped out by human ego and aggression

1,should i change my thoughts on credit first of all i m not even sure this is really a topic for this sub but to me it fits at least somewhat i don t have much in life but at i have no debt i ve always thought this is a good thing but as folks from older generations are quick to tell me this also means i have no credit i don t know what the world is going to look like in years but i fully expect things to be much different in some way or another and just from a practical standpoint spending within your means with money you actually have and not money you might have someday in the future makes good sense it means that in the event of a financial crash i m basically safe it means that no one can come after me and take my shit because i promised someone dollars that i can t pay back but it also means that saving takes a lot longer and in the meantime i don t have shit it means that if i want to buy land and build a small home i m looking at probably saving for another years minimum it means that i have to be careful going into my savings all the time and keep my budget pretty tight and in the last year or so i keep wondering if maybe i should just do something else maybe i should just buy some land with money i don t have put some kind of livable structure on it work on paying that all back as quickly as i can and just be done with it so what it comes down to is this am i a dumb doofus for living on money i actually have or am i smart should i keep living this way or should i try to take advantage of all these structures and institutions while they re still in place so i can actually have the few things i want in this world sooner rather than much later

1,would we ever be able to have the commodities we have now without destroying the planet what would be your ideal society that wouldn t be actively destroying the planet i mean things like having multiple cars huge businesses and factories that pollute traveling by planes ships uncontrolled deforestation using huge areas of land for industrial farming no population control etc would we all have to ride bicycles ebicycles and perhaps have electric public transport like e busses only use larger scale industry for necessities like electricity drinking water producing electricity and everything else from renewable sources and having population control what is your view on this
1,data of electricity by we have to reduce emissions in years but it takes years to do this europe gets of its renewable electricity by burning trees they don t count the emissions because they say that the trees will grow back in years physics doesn t care if we don t count emissions meanwhile we are rushing headlong into food and water shortages by we put billion tons of carbon in the air per year and it will take decades for ccs to sequester even billion of those tons per year with no guarantee of success by cars will produce about gig of data traffic per day by air conditioning alone will use of our renewable energy we now use more energy for less payback fracking while conventional fields run dry runaway hothouse gets triggered between c and those are our aspirational goals we are repeatedly told these goals are scientific they re not ppm of c is safe is not we can t fool our way out of this it s not political it s reality links

1,the world is a domino so following on from this video here i recommend you give it a watch even though it isn t necessary for this post which is a south african youtuber i follow explaining how violence enveloped much of africa following the  of colonial powers i would like the put forward my theory as to what will cause the happening amp xb so prior to rhodesia becoming zimbabwe it supplied much of the food to southern africa nowadays zimbabweans are starving and all their neighbours are starving with the exception of south africa the only country in the region which is supporting the others agriculturally amp xb now as the video says and i think is very likely south africa will probably go the way of its neighbours in that it will be consumed by war as the ex terrorist ruling party tries to maintain power amp xb south africa has a population over million many of whom arent ethnically south african so we can assume that should there be significant civil war many of them will lee to neighbouring countries already unable to support themselves with regards to food after that the now starving south africans with their strained agriculture destroyed by even a single missed harvest will begin to flee not to mention that most of their surviving farmers have already fled or will leave after conflict breaks out amp xb it will take only a couple of million migrants from a country of million compare that to syria which has lost even more form a population of less than million to  the surrounding countries even further with or without food aid from south africa when this happened in previous decades people always fled south south africa is the tip of the continent so people will have to turn around and head north amp xb the whole of southern africa million people will now be starving and millions will move north this  will continue like like dominos through the whole of africa until all billion of us are starving and victims to circumstance the resulting drop in international food aid resulting from a desperate attempt to repair africa will lead to further s and resulting dominoes in other parts of the world south america and central east asia amp xb for scale the current refugee crisis in europe is only million migrants total over around years and already that is straining the fabric of society and the finances of western europe amp xb western europe of million people now has million starving desperate people seeking entry being optimistic pessimistic and accounting for death and lack of ability capability this still leaves nearly million people times what caused the refugee crisis in a fraction of the time trying to gain access to western europe amp xb once it reaches proportions like that there is no doubt in my mind that society is

1,will the united states declare war with china russia or iran i am been following american foreign policy for a while now and currently america has entered a near cold war scenario with russia china and iran which is likely to continue due to american military paranoia and growing chinese ambitions in my opinion biden has promised to return the us back to obama years which will not slowdown american political economic and social decline and may actually lead to more political extremism especially by far right movements in any case do you think biden the neoconservatives or any top us politician and military commanders would try to declare war on any of these countries to drum up support and unify the nation the political economic and social ramifications would be massive i am currently living in southeast asia and generally any war between the us and china would result in mass political and economic unrest especially in asia in addition to this current pandemic

1,responding to  resilience and adaptation i ve updated my article on our converging systemic crises and responding to them it is a long article words with hundreds of sources i ve written it so that i could share a single comprehensive paper to introduce others to the topic of  it is dense and heavy like the topic but i think it addresses  in a way that is easier for someone outside our echo chamber to understand or at least it should plant a seed it also talks about the mental barriers that most people will have when reading it and ends with some actionable ideas without promoting hopium it s divided into two sections the predicament and the possible response at an individual and community level it s a work in progress so constructive feedback is appreciated
1,open letter to the survivors the results from super tuesday are in and they are leaning towards same as it always was with the current administration focused on making news and leading in self benefitting incompetence and inaction chances are that by december americans will ignorantly opt out of a mutually beneficial future as one candidate will foster the pillaging of diminishing returns and the other will likely taper it while privately shaking hands and publicly shaking fingers this is predictably not surprising but it will have ramifications well outside of borders and culture between the climate crisis health threats growing economic gaps the rise of global kleptocracies and willful inaction we are facilitating a period of  that no human has ever before laid eyes on but we will increasingly witness the human experiment has been sabotaged by the human element i have chosen to make this my last argument for engagement i will no longer attempt to describe the view for the blind and i will not decipher the abstract for the literal i won t attempt to change minds nor win hearts i will simply watch learn listen and prepare to the survivors protect your mental and physical health your resources and your loved ones let go of your ego frustration and fear practice mindfulness and temperament and apply it minimally and wisely i hope the spirit of this message is not lost in translation
1,what do you think of jem bendell s deep adaptation paper does it have an irrational negativity bias are any climate scientists making similarly dire predictions i m writing a philosophy paper about what happens when people are intellectually dishonest using climate change as a prime example i like bendell s paper because it s about worst case scenarios which people may carelessly bring about by burying their heads in the sand however i m aware that the paper failed peer review he says it s because his peers didn t think it was a good idea to tell the public about the worst case scenarios but i don t know if he s fibbing i don t want to look like a fool for falling for junk science

1,ipcc pathways hey id just like to throw out some numbers and some q s along the way if im allowed the ipcc predicts that global net human caused emissions of carbon dioxide co would need to fall by about percent from levels by reaching net zero around this means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing co from the air so we become carbon neutral and slow the process of warming everything goes right but what about the effects of c by a cm sea rise increase in ocean acidity frequency of warm extremes over land average drought length extended months million people a year flooded in coastal areas decline in wheat and maize is it just me or will becoming carbon neutral seem like the easy part a new un report suggests that cutting emissions in line with the paris agreement will still rise winter temperatures over the arctic by c c by the ipcc also predicts that by of the permafrost in the northern hemisphere will disappear other research from woods hole research center predicts that even at stabilized c warming we can expect a loss of permafrost by there is an estimated trillion tonnes of carbon in the permafrost now i m not sure what that will mean in regards to the trillion tonnes of carbon that lies within because it is not evenly dispersed though even if percent of the trillion tonnes of carbon were to be released gigatonnes it roughly produce times the global net human caused emissions in maybe we could add a little about dirt here too so we become carbon neutral mitigate the feedback thawing of the permafrost stabilize at c and completely revolutionize the fundamental structure of industrial civilization does anyone think we re out of the hole yet of the world soil and topsoil is classified as degraded and severely degraded of the worlds topsoil is gone bau predicts less food over years against the backdrop of a projected demand requiring us to grow more food in just more years we are projected to have no topsoil remaining now the agricultural sectors have proven for centuries to be strong adaptable and innovative but its still an issue we are going to face in the future with verifiable body counts amp xb some discussion questions does anyone believe following that the ipcc guideline to a net zero human emission by will keep the gmst stabilized at c or below c aerosols appear to be factored in a lots of the models the ipcc has analysed will the extra warming caused by the removal of the aerosols effect be that great not including genocide does anybody see a pathway however unrealistic to lessen the suffering of  and mitigate unstable climate

1,reality collapsing one thing i ve noticed on reddit is the absolute certainty that everyone literally everyone hates trump however his approval rating is actually about the same as obama s was during this point in his term percent i am a stein supporter and a bernie bro but i think misunderestimating trump and his supporters is what lead to and what will lead to his re election if we are not careful but instead of engaging with reality liberals seem to have retreated to the tea party zone where their version of kenyan muslim obama can do no right why does everyone assume trump is so hated when a simple google search shows that he s not statistically particularly disliked

1, friends i ve gone back and forth with posting this because it feels kinda lame but i ll let you guys be the final judge of that so where how does one find allies amidst the madness awareness of the inevitable shitstorm s has inspired me to change big parts of my lifestyle and dream up even more changes i would like to make in the future in many ways i identify with  and that is not something i want to change but a lot of those changes are not things most people are interested in and are not conversations most people want to have it is very alienating at times i would rather feel lonely than surround myself with people who live in a different world than i do but i d also rather not feel lonely i have a family who cares about me but that s not enough because none of them are really on board the best they can do is listen to the extent they are comfortable with it before changing the subject to talk about tv or their latest gadget or something i ve looked at ic org but there s not anything local that looks anything close to active i ve looked at the earth first network and some of the groups they link but there s nothing in my area admittedly the area i m in isn t great for this kind of stuff but damn any ideas
1,when will international sports and concerts  first of all it s kind of amusing that while the world is burning we keep having high profile resource consuming world championships olympic games and whatever else it s an opportunity for people to escape from reality and i guess people will use this opportunity for as long as possible for how long will it be possible to hold these massive events though make some guesses to bring a historic example international sports and concerts effectively ceased during world wars olympic games of and were all cancelled so it will take the everyday life of people to turn into a wartime life to effectively stop having these huge events in climate and economic terms it means the issues will be so huge that all economic resources go towards handling humanitarian issues due to climate disasters hence no money for entertainment when do you think we see the last olympic games i guess something like national football and other team sports leagues last a bit longer than world championship events they can be played on an amateur level even in a mild war time scenario but for how long
1,isn t it theoretically possible to destroy hurricanes assuming a mega huge hurricane is heading towards the mainland and weather models predict it s definitely going to hit rather than shifting out into the open ocean would it be possible to dissipate the winds personally i think we could create some sort of large satellite or space structure that sits in space maneuver it right over the path of the hurricane so it cools down the water using it s shadow it would have to be huge large enough to cast a mile wide shadow in front of the storm in most cases hurricane irma appears to be miles wide and is considered massive
1,what are some of the arguments against the idea that our current economic system is unsustainable as far as i see it money is created primarily through debt to pay off this debt the economy must grow and to do that we need more people or more value created through taking resources from the planet can we just grow in debt forever is that feasible

1, bias long post tl dr at the end amp xb i have been browsing through this subreddit for a few weeks and i am struck by the prevalence of what i could only describe as some kind of eschatological cognitive bias people here tend to see every bad event as a sign of civilizational  it s like you have decided that the world is ending and so you start to see every bad event as evidence of that  rather than the other way around take the recent coronavirus outbreak this subreddit was very quick to jump on this virus as what a potential civilization destroyer if not that then what is its place on this subreddit well what happens when we get through this potential pandemic we ll have a better understanding of viruses of how they spread in our highly connected world and of how to contain them in that world and china will be three hospitals better off so far from taking us towards a civilizational  this virus may better prepare us for future outbreaks yes we may end up short a few hundred thousand people perhaps even a few million but it won t be the end of the world it won t even be a step towards the end of the world globally we will bounce back from this infection in the same way that our own bodies bounce back from infection so again i ask why is it getting the attention of this sub if  is happening right now what is the role of this virus in that  bad things happen all the time they pass and they end up not being the end of the world every time this subreddit goes through a phase of this is it this is the thing that s going to get us to oh it s not that then to oh this is it to oh not that either that s a bit silly no evidence should lead you to the view that the world is ending not the other way around you could say for example that global warming is a real threat to our civilization but if that is your view then upon hearing of the outbreak of a new virus you should not switch over to thinking that this is going to get us before global warming does if that is how you think then you are being led not by the evidence but by a gut feeling that the world is ending you are seeking out evidence in support of your beliefs rather than using evidence to shape your beliefs if this sub had a coherent theory of  and was driven by a desire to test that theory rather than by a desire to indulge a cognitive bias a scroll through the posts here would reveal the following some scientific papers with pessimistic projections of global temperature increases some scientific papers showing progress towards viable nuclear fusion reactors an article about an oil spill and the effects of corporate negligence on the environment more broadly an article about but that s not what we see here instead it s just endless end of the world stuff because here people have already decided that the world is ending and this subreddit provides a nice place to try on different endings like clothes tl dr a subreddit focused on the potential  of civilization should be constantly evaluating evidence from both sides of the story it should not be a circle ing the drain jerk
1,irish potato famine shows a painful lesson on  the survivors tend to not want to think about it the irish potato famine is well documented in america that s because the people who studied about it in america were precisely the very people who were affected by it in ireland itself there was little study on it well over years those who were afflicted by it either died or left ireland those who were more likely to survive and afford to study in good universities were likely to be those who helped the british grain policy and even profitted from it james joyce s the dead set on is a tale of such class gabriel conway an irish catholic professor in the univ of dublin lives a comfortable life completely detached from the hard life of the dubliners mentioned in the rest of the story although that collection of stories does not mention the famine at all even mentioning the hard life of that city did not please the british publishers and joyce had to wait till the summer of when people were paying attention to something more important going on europe to release this book the irish academics who were sheltered from the hardship because their parents and ancestors were well to do during the famine and with lots of skeletons to hide in the closet simply did not study this subject at all well after independence study on the great famine in ireland only began on the s in ireland itself after all these academics with direct memory of skeletons to hide in their family closets all died out of course by then the only eyewitness accounts available were mostly in america so the irish academics studying this subject had to cross the atlantic to do so it is still something the elites of ireland many of them doing so well by complying to british policies and ignoring the plight of their brethren although they probably identified more with the british rulers like gabriel in the dead would rather not talk about that is the cold truth of  those who didn t suffer it directly tend not to want to think about it at all

1,criticisms of tiny homes and towers i think it s worth discussing this as i believe the buildings and transportation networks we have will be a major factor in how  plays out for all the people who think we should advocate for change realize that very influential people have been criticizing suburbia since it began and we have yet to start to move away from it a ton of writing has been done on cities if you re interested lewis mumford is a good start for kunstler fans lewis mumford on kunstlercast suburban sprawl a tragic comedy his best known work is probably the city in history i think the tiny house movement is popular more because it s what people can afford and not necessarily what they want for the people who really do want a tiny home i believe the root of the issue is the freedom people want less debt and less income needed to afford payments not the actual tiny house there is a good balance we should meet in housing and it s not tiny houses mcmansions or condo towers towers are the opposite extreme for people who advocate for density they think we need story towers to be sustainable as you get taller you need things like elevators rather than stairs and the designs are much more complicated to build and maintain ideal cities would have many buildings in the range where all floors can be accessed by stairs with units that are not cramped or overly massive towers are excellent for developers in an industrial economy but terrible in a world where access to machinery and industrial supplies is limited i m in the minority in the city as i believe subsidized housing and rent control are terrible ideas i see it as basically giving people access to a poorly designed city and we re not really solving the main issues i think there s this idea with people that building codes are about safety while that s partly true that s a small part of the picture i think it s difficult to argue that following structural and fire codes are a bad idea but we ve gone way way beyond that zoning along w land use laws this is a big issue housing is largely unaffordable in big cities because of artificial pricing due to zoning i believe these zoning laws are directly contributing to people wanting a tiny home because so many people can t afford the artificially limited housing stock in a world that s collapsing we need dense walkable neighborhoods with multifamily units and businesses throughout a city not only in certain corridors the argument against zoning is typically well we ll have toxic waste next to schools we can t do that this is a hilarious argument as we re nowhere near this now it s really an excuse given by single family homeowners who want a quiet suburban house in the city land use law along with zoning this is another big reason why housing is unaffordable this includes things like minimum number of parking spaces and floor to area ratios the land use laws work in combination with zoning laws to encourage sprawl and low density car dependent development land use laws can also require we build towers which is also a bad idea if anything the land use laws should have higher fars in single family areas and lower fars in urban cores walkability the places people are putting these tiny homes are generally in car dependent areas this is basically micro suburbia for people who can t afford a mortgage it makes far more sense to have density within cities where people can walk most places design review boards if you re not familiar with these take a look you have appointed boards that basically exist to preserve views fit in with existing buildings etc people who own property within these neighborhoods love these design boards as they increase property values of adjacent buildings all of these standards basically exist to support an industrial economy and modern lifestyle all of this works generally well when industrial life is ticking along but once the system starts to decline we will be left w a city that will be increasingly difficult to maintain i m not advocating for solutions i think it s generally a waste of time because most americans don t want real change i believe the needed changes would be so comprehensive and massive that it just couldn t happen once you fix one issue there s another in the way infrastructure is only one issue so solving this issue in developed american cities will only do so much i should add a more dense city with fewer cars will be a step towards less freedom mobility and comfort you ll never convince many people to give up driving and sprawling suburbia if they can afford it because they d be giving up safety comfort and convenience there is no golden age of cities there was always some downside in the past whether it was smog from a factory human sewage having to walk for firewood water crime boredom the list goes on and on of why people moved from farms to cities and cities to suburbia in the first place most people couldn t give a shit about sustainability it s really a side effect of the free time we have now as a result of the successes of industrial life i love the freedom of driving around and going shopping w a credit card and i know most people do too it s largely why we re headed straight for

1,us denialism of chronic covid and the end of the us an article was linked in worldnews today regarding the phenomenon of chronic covid the study tracked people who had symptoms after covid recovery almost of these people still had symptoms months in original article here gt the longfonds treatment center ciro and maastricht university surveyed people who reported they had symptoms after recovering from the coronavirus gt while percent say they do not feel as healthy as they did before the viral infection some percent of this group said they still have breathing symptoms which make it difficult to take a walk and nearly half are unable to exercise of these people were not hospitalized of these people had normal health before coronavirus of these people currently have trouble walking the average age of these people was years old here is another source that attempts to find the incidence of chronic covid this graph comes from the covid symptom study but i m not sure what the constraints on the data were in particular don t know if the day sufferers have been symptom free for very long many of these could turn into long term illness later in addition the ceiling for duration is at days there are millions of people who ve had it for days this means that at least and probably much more than that will have month symptoms so for more than of people possibly as high as percent of people the illness lasts longer than weeks from our first article we already know that among people who had a suspected recovery and then experienced symptoms after that false recovery the rate of experiencing symptoms months later was there s some trouble correlating these two criteria because they re totally different ilness longer than wks is different from experienced a false recovery and then relapsed but most literature suggests these cohorts are not small minorities of people i remember figures from other sources which i will try to find putting the chronic covid rate at somewhere between of all cases on r covidpositive there are thousands of posters who ve been sick for over months i m one of them the hopeful ones chalk this up to post viral fatigue however there is tons of literature on how covid actively avoids immune detection there are cases where people are mildly symptomatic but contagious for months there are cases where completely asymptomatic people release the virus for months or longer there are also cases where people never test positive for the virus and literally die from it tldr there are millions of people who ve had covid for multiple months the incidence of this phenomena is greater than it is unclear if recovery is possible for these people but the available evidence suggests it s unlikely the spread of this virus across the us will ensure a loss of gt of the us population either by loss of life or at least by loss of economic productivity

1,what do you think about predictions from star trek coming true in context of collapsology i used to think star trek was a bore i thought yawn how boring is this show but i ve recently changed my mind i realized theres actually a complex relationship between science and science fiction this understanding motivate me to explore some of timelines and predictions in the star trek chronology in the timeline theres a ww on earth in which seems spot on way things are headed wondering if theres any reason why they picked this particular date it seems if you were to take the fact that the only future where we as a human race survive is one where were able to colonize planets eventuallyyou can kind of work backwards and realize there has to be some kind of transition period in star trek there does seem to be such a period of transition and it looks very well thought out sorry for rambling just some random thoughts question is do you think predictions in star trek have any merit as far as collapsology goes
1,in the shadow of total biosphere  i ve been thinking about this for a while i m typing this out on the fly just to finally get it off my mind for a bit so it s probably not the well cited essay it could should be here goes climate change won t kill us the total  of our biosphere will even if we magically develop carbon capture and reverse warming like we did with the ozone layer we re still fucked because of the global  of fish stocks from strip mining fleets out of se asia the vast expansion of anoxic waters from agricultural amp sewage runoff all along coastlines the presence of microplastic contamination in most ocean sourced products and some fresh water sources and the unknown health effects thereof the mass clearcutting of the amazon to farm beef the rapid extinction of species now spreading into higher order vertebrates the huge decline in insect populations due to everything from pesticide use to rf interference the knock on decline in avian amp bat species the drawing down of aquifers worldwide to farm in soil depleted by decades of intensive industrial agriculture the decline in the alpine snowpacks which feed the rivers used in areas without significant aquifers the rise in heavy metal pollution in water and soil worldwide making it s way up the food chain we aren t irretrievably fucked because the world is going to rise c in a less ravaged world and with a significantly smaller population we could weather that storm and come out the other side with some form of civilization intact we re fucked because we ve so damaged our ecosystem before climate change even starts to cause serious damage we re fucked because to use an analogy for the past half century we ve gone on a bender trashed our house shit in the pantry pissed in the well and set fire to the yard now there is a very large storm coming and there is nowhere else to seek shelter

1,what if it s too late to save our planet without geoengineering guardian article link to the article gt what if it s too late to save our planet without geoengineering moira donegan note this article was posted earlier by u diggergig to r colapse but was removed due to not having a submission statement so it is included here as a self post due to sub repost limitations from the article gt last year when the planet was convulsing with the arrival of a pandemic we pinned our hopes on technology in the form of an mrna vaccine getting us out of our crisis the vaccine was a technological intervention injected into the arms of billions of people could we should we look to technological solutions to our climate crisis too gt gt this is the question posed by holly jean buck in her book after geoengineering climate tragedy repair and restoration zooming with me from buffalo new york where she s a professor of environment at the university of buffalo buck is blunt in her assessment the pace of climate change and the insufficiency of humanity s current response have effectively already made the choice for us mankind will have to engage in some kind of geoengineering an umbrella term for various methods of intentional planetary scale climate intervention whether we like it or not which certainly makes this segment from chapter of the new ipcc report all the more topical gt new evidence strengthens the conclusion from s r that even relatively small incremental increases in global warming cause statistically significant changes in extremes on the global scale and for large regions in particular this is the case for temperature extremes the intensification of heavy precipitation including that associated with tropical cyclones and the worsening of droughts in some regions the occurrence of extreme events unprecedented in the observed record will increase with increasing global warming even at c of global warming project percentage changes in frequency are higher for the rarer extreme events gt gt source ipcc ar chapter pg imo this adds credence to the thinking some have expressed about the pandemic diminishing the aerosol masking effect that in turn may have quickly elevated warming leading to the visible stepwise increase in extreme events over the last months and i imagine if this correlation can be thoroughly demonstrated it could make a pretty convincing public case for deliberate solar radiation management srm at least for those looking to make such arguments although the pictures of extreme events and some of the tough policy choices related to the drought here in the u s west are doing a good job of that all on their own as some already believe it s likely only a matter of time before a few mushy spine politicians and policymakers begin to sit down to talk about deliberately spraying the sky of course by that time the formation of the jet stream in the northern hemisphere may have worsened still making it a real crap shoot of consequences also i imagine if grain stocks continue to make steep declines over a greater area year over year due to increasing temperatures there may be panic so really it s possible a srm geoengineering regime may begin in earnest within just a few years time and like others have expressed here over the years i think srm has been the american shadow policy solution to the climate problem for some time now the only real question i have is how long will they mow the grass before they begin i am not alluding to or referencing chemtrails if this was actually happening on the scale alleged the arctic would likely not be experiencing the accelerated heating observed for decades now

1,will nukes be used to control the impending climate refugee crisis i ve already seen two posts today warning of a full scale nuclear war in the near future maybe it s hopium but i just don t see that happening mad still seems to be working well and nukes would destroy most accessible resources so they d be of limited use in a resource war i m more worried about nukes being used to stop the influx of climate refugees that will likely be happening in the coming years i m just using the us and mexico as examples since that s a border crisis most people here are familiar with let s say millions of south americans cross the border in an attempt to reach canada border control would be hopelessly overwhelmed out of sheer desperation i fear that the us might just nuke the border to irradiate it and deny passage the us has toyed with the idea of using nukes for area denial in the past just look at the davy crockett man portable nuke launcher that was actually deployed but thankfully never used in the korean war gt on the korean peninsula units assigned the davy crockett weapons primarily planned to use the passes that funneled armor as killing grounds creating temporarily deadly radioactive zones roadblocked by destroyed tanks and other vehicles the radiation wouldn t last long but the psychological impact would be immense and likely deter many potential refugees more importantly cobalt can be added to greatly enhance the longevity of the fallout or worse nukes could target cities where large groups of refugees are leaving from this is a bolder move but realistically i don t see any nuclear armed nations stepping in to intervene by that point the us would have proven its willingness to use nuclear weapons in a preemptive manner and there s no point using nukes against the us to avenge a fallen ally in other words you watch from across the street as your psychotic neighbor blows up a homeless person with an rpg because he came to the house looking for shelter the neighbor has a house full of more rockets and you are armed with a handgun what would you do oh and the police un aren t gonna do anything good luck tl dr do you think countries will nuke their own borders to keep out climate refugees if it gets bad enough

1,european question first off this is not meant to be insulting to europe this is just an observation thought i m posting europe provides is citizenry with free healthcare and much better social services than the united states that is great but here is the question aren t europe s social programs mostly possible because america is seen as europe s defense force from russia china while europe does have a military it s questionable how effective the ready fighting force is in short if russia wanted to reclaim the baltics or other eastern bloc nations uk france and germany would not be able to stop it from happening the strongest evidence of this was seen when russia invaded crimea europe basically stared at obama while it sat on its hands amp xb i m sure this will rub some people the wrong way but i m not meaning to do so it s just that the united states is rotting from within and someday our ability to print money will be gone when that occurs our military supremacy will be gone and the power vacuum will be deafening

1,when will the music stop i ve been thinking lately about what would happen if economic growth stopped it seems like people are willing to put up with inequality in the system as long as there is economic growth hey all boats are rising they may even put up with temporary decline as long as there s the hope promise of future growth yet to come in nearly every country where there s riots civil breakdown etc it s where there is a loss of that second part the loss of promise when people no longer see a better future they resort to protest which leads to fear from those in power which leads to violence the most surprising thing about the us right now is the severe lack of protest the list of grievances is long but the majority of people still believe there s future growth along the way or at least the promise of it the system recovered from the meltdown primarily because the true gravity of the situation was hidden from the majority of the population even now it s not widely understood how close we were to the brink what will it take for the majority of the population to start revolting at what point does the collective mindset click over from yeah it sucks but i ll get my fill someday to this is an intolerable humiliation that demands a response
1,the prioritization of the economy over people s lives during covid will result in the death of hundreds of thousands more as we have seen governments around the world are prioritizing their economies of the lives of millions of people during this pandemic again and again people are arguing that it is worth the loss in human life for the sake of the economy so they can go back to living the way they want to rather than changing for the sake of others they say that store will run out of business and people will starve because they don t have money to buy food but if countries efficiently allocated resources as in food and other basic necessities not money then they could easily feed and clothe their populations and keep them safe from the virus this didn t happen though because instead of the first question in people s minds being how can i help others during this pandemic their first question was how can i make money off of this pandemic when they asked themselves the latter those people then decided to hoard items to sell later for a higher price lie and offer fake cures and to misinform others so they could get to things first this pandemic has shown the real condition of society as a whole now and proved how sick society has become why do people value money over people s lives even the governments at first lied about not knowing if mask where helpful or not so they could guarantee that their health workers would have mask rather than being honest and asking for help in the production of more mask imagine what would have happened if we were able to trust each other and everyone worked together that would have been a beautiful sight but in stead we got this shit show i hope people learn from this disease and decide to start working towards helping others because if people don t then a whole lot more people are going to die it s time to get hopeless now because if we don t become hopeless then we won t be open to changing the way things are now

1,is there any case for optimism just what it says on the tin climate change of the catastrophic variety seems so inevitable and it doesn t seem like biochar or beccs is enough to offset it and surely albedo modifications would just hinder solar power which is already unable to provide during peak times and that s assuming it somehow doesn t lead to some kind of world war the refugees and starvation seem to already be occurring is there anything to suggest that this can be avoided or reversed i m not seeing much reason to be hopeful of more than a year or two more of business as usual and feel as though i ve been diagnosed with a terminal illness and that everyone around me has as well and doesn t realize it

1,so what will actually happen if the dollar becomes useless in hyperinflation there will still be tens and tens of millions of people who plan on going to work everyday who plan on going to the grocery store who plan on paying rent or mortgages purchasing cars going on vacations and whatever else they currently enjoy the percentile what will actually happen to them will they no longer go to work as executives business owners doctors lawyers engineers professors etc in what way will they be paid if all of a sudden it costs to buy a single meal certainly this group of people would not end up homeless on the streets and certainly they will not be able to afford for a loaf of bread prices at current earnings rates even if they do have million saved they will burn through that savings very quickly so what will happen will this group ultimately become slaves to poverty or will the entire system reform itself and use a new currency because the top quartile chooses not to live a life of shame
1,what if the  is a good thing what if we can build a new better world from the ashes of the old hi y all i m new to this sub so sorry if this post is inappropriate or whatever so i m a little drunk now and i was thinking that if this  of society is now inevitable as it s happening before our very eyes once it s all said and done will there still be hope for the future i mean the native americans lived a completely renewable sustainable existence for thousands of years why can t we sure the climate will be all fucked by then but i m just trying to find an optimistic angle here could we the survivors with the wisdom of what we ve experienced create a more renewable egalitarian society is there any hope left perhaps total societal  is the only way it could happen like posadism or something
1,was this our one and only shot at world domination via civilisation this question has been prompted by a comment i made on another post something that occurred to me the other day is that this last blossoming of our civilisation was aided by the easy access to resources oil was literally seeping out of the ground in the us coal was falling out of cliffs at several locations in europe there was gold that could be picked panned out of rivers with relative ease we didn t need to discover these things and others we had to try not falling over them if when the climate recovers in a way conducive to human population growth again these staples of civilisation won t be lying around it may be that without these readily available resources to hand we never make the steps towards industrialisation we made this time around

1,take your lives from this planet if you want it to end so bad be remembered as heroes euphemism this is a euphemism an exaggerated criticism of a blank slate and if you feel part of it this is for you i appreciate the transparency of climate facts but if you want to save what s left let others manage this information holistically you are a waste of oxygen if this sub is only a loop of data and indifference overpopulation and lack of resources are your biggest fears so i say let climate scientists and sociologists work together without your help maybe you have the best intentions but this two ideas deflect the rest a common argument here is save yourself and your family it makes me think of you as upper class families who are fine with inequality and won t collaborate in redistributing resources maybe you have the wet dream of getting in a bunker or in a nuclear submarine or go out in space or just watch the world burn it won t happen you will die either because of excessive heat or because the working class will organize and take everything from you including your lives the  is of western civilization a k a white culture and it has come to the beginning of the end for those of you that don t fit workers anti fash ecologists etc get in touch with leftists and embrace intersectionality if this is too offensive feel free to destroy me with facts and logic or just erase this

1,how does japan get by without its nuclear power just hit me that japan still has not restarted its nuclear power plants a quick adding of the figures on wikipedia gives that the country currently gets by with a mw thermal shortage of nuclear power lets say they import electric power from neighbouring countries did they in that case just happen to have an extra nuclear reactors standing by or do they compensate by running oil burning reserve plants a lot of reserve capacity in that case or do they just get by without it corresponds to about of consumption if this is true it really put things in perspective i mean if you can shut down nuclear reactors or if you like and still maintain a country such as japan perhaps society is more resilient than we think
1,the american election i predict a major  of american democracy and the dollar with it the day after the american presidential election i m just trying to sort out how it would go down because its going to happen just a question of what sequence of events happens afterwards so like the flair says spoiler alert the election happens massive russian interference and hacking occurs but for the most part the votes of most areas are correctly tabulated and trump has taken a major beating trump decides that because of the voting irregularities we re going to have to take a look at what happened before we make any decisions he does not concede the election bernie makes victory speech anyways bill maher says told ya so two days go by and trump still has not suggested that he has lost only that there was a major major amount of hacking going on and we re trying to determine how and where it happened and we re going to get back to you about that but we think we won but that the votes were flipped in the democrats favor but we re looking in to it stay tuned folks outrage starts to grow thousands upon thousands of open carry types march on washington to secure the election results and make sure democracy is carried out of them are trump supporters they leave in their wake s of used insulin needles across the ne usa kylie jenner appeals for calm on instagram because of the call to action a million supporters of bernie sanders leave work and also go to washington armed with pink hats and protest signs the police are overwhelmed and the media is over hyping the already dangerous situation everyone decides to stay in dc it looks like an occupy movement made up of two camps police start arresting people on both sides another day passes and the stock market is not doing very well massive drops following the marches and occupation fbi makes announcement that the election results are skewed and they can t tell how but there was massive hacking within the election the media makes the situation even worse by saying that exit polls don t match results in many situations although it does seem that bernie sanders won via exit data and that the hacking didn t affect much of the actual outcome kanye suggests that everyone should just stay cool and wait for things to sort out because of the revelations president trump decides that he did not lose because incumbent presidents rarely do and he is still president the occupation in dc goes nuts and people start to riot police get out of the way until shots ring out people are dead no one knows what happened but people without guns wearing pink hats are down and the media is reporting that trump doesn t seem to be doing anything about the violence other than allowing the police to attempt to settle it down people stop going to work its like all over again everyone is just watching their flavor of news broadcast getting more and more worked up as the media talks about stolen elections authoritarianism and this is how it happened in germany rants rachel maddow has a hour long election coverage special where she lays out just how we all got here how the gop refused to secure the elections how it was common knowledge that the voting machines were not tamper resistant at all how voter fraud could barely cover all of this she is one of the lone voices coming out completely against trump cnn is being neutral and boring and suggesting that maybe we should have another election tucker carleson says democrats are just sore losers and that perhaps if we can t have free and fair elections we should just decide who gets to be president some other way the next day the stock market plummets on opening bell americas allies have no faith in it anymore united states supreme court begins to deliberate election outcome bernie sanders makes a speech about the end of american democracy if we do not fight tooth and nail for it he s banned from r politics for advocating violence when he mentioned fighting trump hotels and properties are vandalized and attacked by protesters kylie jenner appears in her instagram posing while wearing a beret and holding an ak media continues to stoke the fires fox news makes a call for all patriots to go to washington and their state capitols to defend them from tyranny mitch mcconnel suggests that the real issue was with people who did not have the right to vote voting in the election and demands a recount of florida and other key very black states and an investigation in to voter fraud msnbc continues to ask why the gop did not do more to secure the elections more people start making their way towards washington to defend the protesters there that were being shot at trump finally calls in national guard to get these people these protesters causing all the damage to our nations capitol off the streets and in prisons where they belong riots worsen cops are hurt buildings are set on fire in dc cities all over america hold protests and rallies some are violent many people being hurt hospitals are not flooded but seeing a major increase in violent injuries from street fighting because of the increase in protesters and lack of national guard on scene more bernie supporters arrive some of them are armed some of the trump supporters are shot and wounded police from all surrounding areas now descending on dc national guard about to deploy ussc has an announcement later in the afternoon but waits until ng on scene in dc supreme court decides that donald trump is to remain president dc erupts in chaos trump orders the national guard to target the protesters not the law abiding gun owners protecting the capitol from them many national guard troops quit on the spot over the obvious theft of the election dc is unsecured as shooting starts on both sides ex ng troops make up the bulk of the bernie supporters covering the unarmed protesters and firing back at the those defending the white house from the protesters the shooting goes on until early morning trump calls in the military tanks arrive on the streets of dc finally thinks trump the stock market crashes trump suggests foul play by those who hacked the election bernie sanders vows to lead resistance against trump himself many us cities are in flames open carry trump supporters walk the streets along side police making sure that the protesters don t break anything else many people are murdered outrage all over the internet other nations look at america in disgust many are saying that they will have to reevaluate their relationship with the united states and look to another nation for world leadership maybe germany reports start to come in that kanye west has been shot in an altercation in his home he has died kylie jenner is in custody national guard troops on many american streets walmart parking lots being used as detention and supply areas for troops no one is buying anything anyways trump supporters can sign up to be in a special branch of law enforcement which will help assist law enforcement in their communities with trouble makers and petty crimes taking place trump squad is officially formed and you can register online and go to your local recruiting office for instructions on training programs the next day while many are back at work reports start to come in about an attack on a middle school in the middle of nowhere in texas then reports about it happening in arizona southern california many confusing reports about shootings in schools and towns along the us southern boarder it takes all day but police from around the state merge to the areas where the reports are coming from and neutralize the attackers a couple thousand people are dead very many of them children its one of the worst terror attacks in us history with nearly as many people wounded as were killed in investigators will quickly discover the orgy of evidence on the attackers bodies and in their cars which indicates that they are ex iranian republican guard members who with the assistance of the drug cartels in mexico were able to acquire automatic weapons on the us boarder and use them to extinguish the lives of many americans in a suicide run on schools and community centers businesses and malls in america these terrorists looked to gain an advantage while we were distracted by the antics of a party of sore losers but we will not fall we will be strong stronger than ever and we will retaliate against those that attacked us and they will pay very very dearly for attempting to sabotage us while were exercising our democracy trump squad members go on a tear throughout america getting revenge for the attacks on anyone who is brown and vulnerable national guard and military kill many on both sides while trying to settle the nation down trump moves american troops on to the border for real this time suggests that he might have to take the guns away from everyone troops move km in to mexico to protect americans living on the border emergency border wall construction begins very seriously with usmc engineering squads providing most of the labor initially but in the coming months those arrested for illegally entering the country will be forced on to chain gangs to fill and carry sandbags to help support border security america is said to be under an occupation of its own military and police by nations critical of the events in the usa americans start to appeal to the un for help and many flee to friends and relatives in canada and mexico of them are daca dreamers escaping ice persecution trump signs an executive order authorizing an immediate retaliatory attack on iran and while congress protests because they have limited his authority on iran significantly there are only too many admirals in the us navy only too willing to follow his orders iran protests its innocence and claims that the terrorists were not on orders from tehran iran suggests that the terrorists were somehow coerced in to committing the attack since they had nothing to gain and it was a suicide mission and suspects that elements of a foreign nation forced the men to carry out the attack mexico says that its ridiculous that the cartels would help iran there is nothing in it for them nothing to be gained everyone is now calling for a border wall tomahawk missiles rain down on iran anyways iran overwhelms antimissile defenses in saudi arabia and israel and oil refineries and tel aviv are completely leveled s of american troops in iraq are killed the bases then overrun by iraqi freedom fighters then by the latest incarnation of isis israel nukes tehran millions are dead ice in cooperation with the military begins to round up anyone with any ties to mexico iran and puts them in massive emergency holding facilities bernie sanders and rachel maddow are arrested for plotting a coup against the administration msnbc cnn are ordered to be nice to the president during this difficult time internet mass censorship starts to appear in america for the first time users noticing posts are disappearing if they are critical of trump computers and devices of those critical of the war start to malfunction or simply stop working websites of democratic party users stop responding to requests its like they are no longer online since he acted without approval of congress they move to censure him and multi day long argument ensues as to whether he had the right to retaliated against iran or not trump threatens nancy pelosi with imprisonment if she doesn t start to act properly trump issues an order restricting all new gun sales gun stores all over the us start to panic trump assures everyone this is temporary until ice and the military get a handle on troubled individuals looking to sow chaos in our communities all their inventories are seized no records of what was taken are made polls find that people who previously supported biden during his run for president are now supportive of trump in his efforts to combat terror in the us and overseas biden says he is supportive of the presidents efforts in this time of need and so should we all be other countries begin to move troops towards israel as surviving iranian troops and civilians organize to strike back against israel jordan is unable to stop the flood of troops pouring in to the country and might not be trying to lebanon and syria attempt to shell positions in israel palestinian protests fire s of grenades and drones in to israel saudi arabia appeals for calm while bombing convoys on route to israel in an effort to boost the stock market trump releases a new tax plan that allows anyone making over million dollars a year to invest in the markets instead of paying taxes ivanka opens a new company which supplies food and medicine to rich people in need during civil unrest people start to find shelves empty in stores as panic buying begins rush and alex jones begin to make millions selling products designed to protect white people from brown people a joke starts to go around the world a progressive a centrist and a trump supporter are admiring a painting of adam and eve in the garden of eden the trump supporter says they must be progressives they re naked and they re eating fruit the centrist says clearly they re centrists observe how politely the man is offering the woman the fruit the progressive notes they are trump supporters of course they have nothing to wear nothing to eat and they think they are in paradise saturday night live is cancelled colbert is replaced by tucker carleson on the late show seth myers is in hiding with bill maher covfefe added to websters dictionary it is very recommended by the administration that everyone watch one hour of fox news every day pollsters from trump squad go door to door to ask people what they liked about what they saw on fox that day its found that people are being revenge murdered in the night by their own neighbors people are puzzled how this could happen in their communities and they are scared the police may be allowing these revenge murders to occur rogue trump squad members suspected to be the perpetrators some people in smaller communities start sleeping in shifts in their homes the entire us military is mobilized for deployment to saudi arabia iraq and israel to help to secure those countries and find the rest of the terrorists scattered through out the entire middle east operations against any and all countries friendly or not begin if the cia or military intelligence feels there is ample reason to go in to them to kill targets its not even february yet but as the radioactive cloud of debris from the israeli attack on tehran slowly begins to encircle the globe world war has begun in the middle east americans start dropping bombs on convoys headed in its direction but trump has secured his future as president maybe forever now that the all of america looks like atlantic city and all for his personal benefit and the billionaires that supported his efforts to oppress anyone who stood against them however a small faction of individuals no one knew who they were or why they did it but some suspect they were made up of people from afghanistan who had lost everything during the war they were caught between the taliban and the american occupation forces it was rumored some had relatives stuck inside guantanamo for nearly years using information gained from the russians long before their puppet gained the presidency they snuck in to unsecured facilities that were critical for power distribution in the us wearing explosive vests they blew themselves and those facilities up simultaneously placing america in the dark permanently and the rest of the world wondering what has happened to it only ham radio signals are getting out of the usa and the general consensus is that no one knows what happened outside of a few people who knew that facilities exploded for some reason but stories even first hand ones are sketchy at best everyone is literally in the dark then the radio broadcasts stop too trump suspends civil liberties america is under martial law police have the right to shoot on sight anyone caught outside after curfew without question wars erupt in the streets of america over food and safety issues many are put down quickly by drone strike trump squad is semi officially disbanded although many continue to act as spies for the military occupation in exchange for food and medicine and fuel congressional members protest the suspension of civil liberties but after some are arrested the others fall in line the average american is now sitting in the dark in the cold in mid december they have no money and no savings not that there is anything to buy anyways there is no electronic communication the local paper when it does publish a few pages are stuck cork boards in towns and city centers suggest that everything is going to be okay and the people who attacked the electrical grid are going to pay for what they did to our country people start to die from the shortages of medication and power as it gets colder people are hunting and camping in national parks for basic survival trump took my guns and my insulin i maybe got a week or so to live unless i get some medication we re hoping the nat guard comes through with it and i was on trump squad since day one dammit just not fair says an ex trump squad member work gangs are formed up of people without critical rolls basically everyone who had a minimum wage job before the election unless they can prove that they voted for the administration is forced to work to dig coal to provide fuel and heat for the towns and cities they live in people are burning garbage and wood to stay warm and for cooking the smog over america is thick and it mingles with the radioactive debris in the atmosphere made of iranians who were living in tehran its still burning months after the strike putting megatons of cancerous pollutants in to the air every day counties down wind of the strike protest but no one listens since the entire region is in flames anyways those that can t work or won t work are placed in detention centers far from where they live they are never seen again but crematoriums across america are working day and night and bodies are only being mostly burned the remaining remains are placed in mass graves and burned once more with white phosphorus and can be seen for miles with smoke that ironically reminds some people of their time at burning man mitch mcconnell does a rail and says i ve finally destroyed america for their war on the south so many of those disgusting poors are finally dead and their ancestors and history in this country erased but so much more left to do though isn t there putin picks up his glass toasts him takes a sip and helps himself to some nose candy but this evening let us just enjoy our success he says in flawless english with only a mild accent as the head of the young girl he had stashed under the table the two were sitting at bobbed up and down over his lap trump looks out over the white house front lawn at the tanks troops and the fires burning across washington and thinks to himself i ve done it i showed them all
1,a full life by paolo bacigalupi the most realistic depiction that i ve come across of life in the near future by the time rue reached she had begun to measure her life by her many moves the parchment of her life torn into fragments each one reducing the integrity of the whole each small leaf then folded folded and shaped until it became surreal origami tear here fold there this part became a house burning down tear here fold again this shred became a rusty diesel truck driving south tear again fold this bit became an apartment building without a roof tear here tear again make a casket keep tearing rue s first move came when she was eight her mother and father selling the small acreage farm they d cultivated in a colorado valley they d been part of a late millennial wave of hipster farmers fleeing the cities meaningless consumerism for something more natural they d grown organic microgreens for farm to table restaurants in nearby ski towns we live like people are supposed to live her father said slower more connected focused on the land then the maroon treasury fire burned aspen when the smoke cleared trees stood barestick black against hot blue sky and the air reeked of char ski slopes drifted with ash moguls then slumped with mudslides in the aftermath rue collected trophies from amongst the blackened anasazi like ruins of billionaire mansions picking her way through concrete foundation outlines aluminum puddled in silver castings rivulets of melt glass globs sparkled treasure gems the remnants of picture windows at first rue s mother and father had laughed seeing people who had complained about dirt specks in their radish greens fleeing an inferno that cared not for their wealth a certain schadenfreude was inevitable but other mountain towns were dying as well drought whittling away their picturesque scenery thinning their snowpack and choking their summer skies with smoke rue s parents might have held on but failing snows meant inadequate irrigation water and soon their domestic water failed too the aquifer below their home unable to recharge old timers laughed that they d bought land with bad irrigation rights and a crummy well my dad says you should have seen it coming rue s friend hunter said everyone knows how water rights work course your water got cut off it never happened before rue retorted my dad says you should have known they stopped talking because of that soon after rue moved later rue heard that hunter s family went dry too a family that had ranched and farmed the same land for six generations rue wrote a text asking if hunter s dad should have seen it coming but she deleted it before sending rue was sad about that first move leaving her small familiar town she remembered the moving truck belching diesel smoke reeking and clanking unlike the electric pickup they d used for the farm her mother told her they couldn t take her big clothes dresser with them we can t fit it in the austin apartment sweetheart her mother gave her a new phone to console her rue couldn t take big furniture but she could have her first phone that at least was portable on the drive south rue called her grandmother oh sweetpea nona consoled i know you re sad but there s a silver lining to this there s a big world to learn about plus you ll get to see the bats the bats despite herself rue was intrigued there are bats in austin lots of them seeing more of the world meant you were less ignorant than if you just lived in one small place all your life and that was a good thing that s what nona said nona never really approved of college kids being farmers so she was glad they were moving that s what dad said in austin rue s mother played ukulele in a band and her father drove an electric delivery truck some nights they d walk along the colorado river watching bats stream out from under the congress avenue bridge to catch insects the city skyline glowed in the sunset the buildings newly covered with perovskite solar skins all of them a little shiny because of it some people said things weren t the same as before some of the bats were invasive bloodsuckers instead of insect eaters but they were still bats and rue liked them rue s new school was big with way more friends than just hunter also there was a ballet class and a tae kwon do class plus an old lady with purple hair who taught rock drumming you see nona said things work out but then came a summer night when the electric grid went down a hundred and ten degrees at a m everyone already on water restrictions pitch dark in the middle of a city everyone out on the streets desperate to catch a breeze everyone complaining blaming environmentalists battery companies natural gas companies austin energy federal regulations texas s love affair with low taxes rue s dad said texas hadn t anticipated how record heat would stress their grid rue got heatstroke her parents decided to move rue s mother already had a job working remotely for a miami based mortgage company she could get a promotion if she moved in house in miami rue s father drove a three wheeled short range electric hauler delivering iced fish to restaurants rue swam sometimes in the ocean when jellyfish and algae weren t choking up the coast it was okay during their weekly phone chats nona told her about cubanos you see nona said when rue tried one it s better when the sugar brews into the coffee i first tried one when i vacationed in cuba but italian espresso is the best how do you know all these things rue asked nona laughed well i lived a full life and it was much cheaper to fly back then it s harder now with all the aero taxes i wish i could fly places well maybe we ll save our money and go to italy then annaleen hit the hurricane wasn t serious by florida standards but it seemed big to rue cat on the new meteorological scale it s nothing her father told her as rain lashed their apartment windows the new scale goes to her mother laughed and made an air guitar motion rue didn t get the reference so they showed her spinal tap on youtube rue laughed with her parents because they were laughing at the idiot guitarist and his amp but the clip didn t make her feel safe so much as make her wonder what a hurricane that went to might feel like a month later carrie hit carrie accelerated from nms cat to cat during two phenomenal days the governor declared a state of emergency florida huddled down unable to flee water boiled up out of storm drains and filled the streets long before the worst winds hit miami s brand new seawalls disappeared swamped on both sides the sheer volume of water overwhelmed the city s new pumping stations they shorted and shut down rue huddled with her parents and members of her mother s new band in their apartment the blue palms was the safest apartment complex in the neighborhood built to endure the new meteorological scale the blue palms are rock solid her father said when we moved here i thought this through down on the street the band s van floated away literally floated rue watched people float away too before miami could recover from carrie delia hit just bad luck everyone said but to rue it was starting to feel like god was bowling against them there wasn t enough time to recover to breathe to restock supplies god just kept bowling delia ripped the roof off the blue palms popped it off like a can opener by the time sunny skies returned their windows were gone and one wall had crumbled something big and heavy had blasted into the masonry and then flown away a car a tree a bus no one could say they used bedspreads and sheets to cover the windows makeshift shelter while they waited for maintenance to fix things then word came down that the apartment company was abandoning the building its insurance company was going bankrupt from too many claims so the apartment company was walking away too leaving everyone squatting in the ruins well on the bright side at least we re not paying rent rue s mother joked a dark bright side because the mortgage company that employed rue s mother was going bankrupt too with insurance failing people were walking away from wrecked homes leaving mortgages unpaid sending ripples through the financial system why pay mortgage on a house that would never be fixed where s fema her father complained as he pumped brown water through a handmade filter of charcoal and sand and paper towels there should be some kind of backup for this sweating and dripping with the work shirtless he was skinny rue realized not as big and strong as he d seemed when she was younger just a scared skinny man with new streaks of white in his bushy beard there were supposed to be emergency funds for this they re doing what they can with what they ve got rue s mother soothed there are other places that need help too they re overwhelmed that was the crux of the problem god had gone bowling all across the south fort lauderdale tampa and mobile alabama all had been hit hard over in texas houston had gone under again corpus christi too and that was just the big cities the places people could name all the small towns maybe they were there maybe they were drowned and gone who could say no one could get there to find out as for miami it was finally draining the streets reeked of ancient motor oil and fish and shit and garbage that had boiled out of sewers and dumpsters and basements flies and mosquitoes and orphaned dogs swarmed over it but at least the city was draining some people said miami had enough money to survive boosters were already imagining a future hurricane hardened version of the city now that they d drowned they could visualize the armored venice like miami they should have built the first time they d make their buildings float goddamnit money liked miami rue s mom said so maybe the city really would make it new orleans on the other hand new orleans was a bathtub and money didn t give a damn about new orleans money was racist that s also what rue s mom said unlike money mosquitoes didn t discriminate they loved all the cities on the coast equally and all the people too mosquitoes snuck through the broken windows the high whine of their wings always in rue s ears the welts of their bites always on her skin screening was sold out fema mosquito nets had been hoarded walmart kept saying delivery trucks would come soon for sure everyone got covered with bites they all got fever from it nona said it was a new malaria strain something the cdc had warned about but it hadn t been faced because the damn republicans kept cutting funding now here the disease was just like epidemiologists had predicted for some reason kids and old people survived better middle aged people often died that s what rue s dad did nona cried when rue and her mother skyped the news why was dad so mad at nona rue asked later why didn t he want to live around her her mother made a reluctant face finally she said nona was always complaining about problems but she never lived like she needed to do anything about them and she hated that we tried to farm i think she felt like we were insulting her judging how she lived her own life but you were right it bothered dad a lot that nona made certain choices especially after you were born like flying in airplanes and cars and eating meat she shook her head anyway that s all a long time ago everybody did it and they all made it worse for everyone not just nona later rue asked nona about it mom says dad was mad at you because he didn t like how you lived oh sweetpea this is the world we live in we have to take at least a little joy in it her eyes were wet life s short we have to enjoy something you should enjoy something too i wish you had something you could enjoy she sent rue some money on her phone to buy something nice but rue didn t know what that would be their apartment was a wreck and they were about to move again rue didn t want more things except maybe a mosquito net rue wondered what it would have been like to fly to the far side of the world to go to someplace like italy to drink espresso or fly to japan and see the temples of kyoto where nona had once gone to meditate nona hadn t sent enough money for either of those things nona wanted them to join her in boston but rue s mom preferred new york they went to live with her brother armando uncle armando said the people in florida deserved what they got those lame ass seawalls some political appointee just made up the standards that s why manhattan used the european standards say what you want about the taxes here at least we don t fuck around with our science he shook his head at the stupidity of miami as he cut into his steak of course they were fucked he said gesturing with his fork as he chewed they were fucked from the moment they used those shitty american standards please don t say it that way her mother said rubbing her temples she hadn t touched the meat on her plate say what fucked you know i don t like it five cities are underwater and you re worried about my fucking language he laughed in disbelief the language is what bothers you he shook his head gestured at her plate try the steak he said it s kobe rainforest i m not hungry carbon free cruelty free it s right up your alley you can t even tell it s vat meat zero methane zero deforestation your husband would have loved this sh this stuff give it a try maybe later suit yourself he cut another chunk for himself you like the steak rue yeah it s good damn right it is he forked another bite returned to his previous point talking around the mouthful some jackass lobbyist for some oil company wrote that shitty standard just like lobbyists did with mercury and methane and all the other crap and then dumb ass miami just went ahead and used the sea rise estimates fucked themselves is what they did armando rue s mother said there are real people involved it s not just one of your investment spreadsheets you know i shorted miami right her mother glared armando subsided but the word lingered in rue s mind fucked she was more than old enough to know the word she knew how to say it in six different languages thanks to the kids she d met in her different moves they used it all the time who fucked who how fucked up the vocab test was fuck you fuck me fuck principal vasquez that was a snapchat group but the word had been casual and they d used it casually they hadn t felt it they hadn t understood it miami was fucked and now the word finally sounded right fucked hard and nasty and mean it described the world rue experienced every day the one the grownups in her life seemed bent on pretending didn t exist like if they pretended really really hard they d be okay like they d pretended the miami seawalls were big enough like nona had pretended that flying on airplanes was fine they d closed their eyes and pretended and now everyone was fucked it was almost a relief to have armando say it to have that word squat on the dinner table with the organic kale and the arsenic free brown rice it gave shape to an unformed feeling that had been lurking in rue s mind for some time something she d been unable to name or describe because all the grownups around her hadn t been honest enough to speak it clearly it felt like a door being kicked open as soon as armando said it it felt blazingly obvious and now that rue could see it she could see it everywhere in the cost of bread and cheese and vegetables and chicken in the kids begging on the streets in the storm warnings as winter hurricanes made their way up the coast dropping rain and jamming rivers with ice floes and slamming against manhattan s own seawall barriers rue s mom had promised new york would be good for them it was where she d grown up but old new york was different from fucked new york armando was the only one with a job and things were changing even for him all over the country people s homes were being destroyed by sea level rise forest fires droughts storms and floods people were going reffee and leaving behind ruined houses and mountains of debt so now along with mortgage companies and insurance companies banks started failing armando s shorting of miami he d explained to rue that shorting meant betting a place was going to get fucked only worked if there was a safe place to stash his winnings six months after rue and her mother moved to new york the fdic d and the dollar fell off a cliff bank after bank went down traders all over manhattan went bankrupt whole hedge funds wall street ground to a halt checking accounts froze people lost their savings lost k s s iras it was like all the money in the world evaporated rue s mom decided to send rue to boston i don t want to live with nona i want to live with you rue begged as she hugged her mother goodbye at the bus station as soon as i have a job you ll be back with me her mother said wiping her eyes another bit of pretend the grownups were all playing pretend everyone except armando who hugged her and shoved a small sweaty wad of cash into her hand good luck kiddo keep this for an emergency got it an emergency i will i m sorry about your job yeah well i knew i should have bought yuan he sucked his teeth irritated i got into this work because i swore i was never going to dig ditches now i m not even sure they ll let me do seawall construction too many reffees competing for that shit he looked completely different now that his investment company was gone the bus to boston passed through three mass pike checkpoints they scanned her familypass bar code again and again kids with fake documents got pulled off the bus and sent back each time state patrol scanned her pass she expected it would be her i wish you d come here sooner nona said as she hugged rue in south station i have room i always had room for you she hugged rue tighter and for a minute in the middle of the bustling terminal rue felt safe the t was sardine packed even at noon despite the migration controls refugees swamped boston everyone s trying to get in nona said as they sweated up the line i ve been renting my spare rooms on airbnb rents are crazy it helps with the food prices though i don t know how other people are affording food with all the droughts nona cleared out a whole family from alabama to give rue a room i have to get back to the hospital nona said as she changed the bedsheets if you go out watch out for muggers there s not enough work for people nona was a psychiatrist who specialized in trauma the state paid her to prescribe antidepressants and anti anxiety meds to refugees benzos are cheap she joked hospital beds are expensive and the heat makes everyone crazy nona also said not to get too comfortable her single family house was being torn down for a density project she was moving to a high rise they ve got plans for this old place boston definitely seemed to have plans billboards called greater boston a city of the future they d banned cars from alewife all the way to the ocean only electric trams and occasional emergency vehicles used the narrowed main roads remaining streets were being converted into e bike paths and gardens climbing vines shaded walking paths for summer enclosed skyways leapt from high rise to high rise for the winter not a drop of gasoline anywhere rue could see how pleasant the city was supposed to be but it was groaning under the weight of reffees from all the places that hadn t planned the school rue was supposed to attend which nona said was excellent was overflowing kids were being given disposable tablets and asked to do khan academy instead of assignments from living teachers they sat cheek by jowl crosslegged on the floors with security proctors watching over them rue started ditching killing time down by the charles river with some other reffee kids jiyu a girl from coastal north carolina and josh a kid from iowa who d never lived in a city before but who rue had taken under her wing when she found him making origami out of trashed mcdonald s wrappers most days they d perch atop the new charles river levees and skip rocks across warm algae choked waters occasionally trading hits on josh s asthma inhaler up in canada whole beetle killed forests were burning and the smoke kept blowing south burnt canadians they called it they rated the boston weather by how thick the canadians were and how many asthma hits they needed a pair of joggers wearing fluorescent athletic gear and nike particulate masks pounded past giving them dirty looks how do they know we re not from here josh asked taking another inhaler hit what do they see rue had wondered about that too she d been chased by local boston kids multiple times gangs of them intent on schooling the newcomers she wondered if maybe she and her friends held their bodies differently like dogs that had been kicked too many times instinctually cowering kinda makes you hope one of these levees breaks josh said rue could imagine it happening could imagine boston despite its attempts to harden and adapt drowning just like all the other places she d been she wondered if it would happen or if boston would somehow manage to do better not play pretend maybe do something right on rue s way home a crew of boston kids jumped her bursting out of a humid alley she curled in a ball on the pavement as they beat and kicked her they left her bruised and crying with final gobs of spit and warnings to go back where she d come from by the time she finally limped home it was dark inside she found nona peacefully asleep in her easy chair the tv streaming netflix rue stood in the flickering darkness tasting the blood in her mouth and clutching her bruised ribs her grandmother shifted in her sleep the air conditioner droned fighting the october heat even with the doors and windows closed rue could smell the canadians burning the world that had existed before for thousands of years going up in smoke rue tried to remember a time when something in her life hadn t been on fire or underwater or falling apart and realized she couldn t she tried to remember a time when she had slept as peacefully as nona nona said she loved rue but all rue felt was empty distance between them the shredded gap between the life her grandmother had enjoyed and the tatters that rue had inherited her grandmother had drunk espresso in italy and meditated in the temples of kyoto she d lived a full life rue imagined strangling her

1,general discussion is rising income inequality good for climate change i just finished watching dr sid smith s how to enjoy the end of the world again it got me thinking about income inequality i was wondering what people s thoughts were on how income inequality and redistribution of wealth would affect consumerism and co emissions let s say for example that bill gates wealth was not concentrated in the gates family but spread evenly among tens of thousands of families would we not then have many more families trying to increase quality of life and buying more vehicles dish washers a c units etc we know from many articles that those in the west who enjoy high quality of life also contribute the most to co emissions and waste is it better for the planet to actually restrict the general population coming up the so called ladder don t know where exactly to post this but i thought the people of r  might have some interesting ideas on this i don t have anyone in my personal life to discuss this with
1,what do you say to someone who doesn t believe in any of these signs of doom and therefore refuses to prepare for or attempt to delay the inevitable for instance if you deny there s a problem at all you don t have to find a solution for it therefore if you refuse to believe in climate change and the alarming worst case scenario timeframes then not only are you less likely to help everyone else do something about it but you re an outright enemy of human survival are you not

1,upcoming elections we all know this next election will be big but how big last election we saw a lot of violence from the left and right ever since then it has slowly been brewing both side are becoming more and more radical made obvious by the recent republican voter registration attack right now is just the calm before the storm not a lot of voters are going out bc its not trump vs dem yet once the campaigning begins i believe we will slowly see protests clashing like last year but it will start taking a violent turn quickly and i believe will most likely lead to voter intimidation if this is left unchecked before too long and it will cause a complete fracture between the two parties both claiming illegitimate elections and destroy the government in the process and in the worst case cause a full scale republican vs democrat conflict or even civil war
1,questions about kaolin clay as a natural pest repellant in the garden assuming there could be a  i have been studying and working on my fruit and vegetable gardening skills i do not support toxic chemical pesticides i learned that kaolin clay powder can be mixed with water and applied to plants to protect them from things like aphids and japanese beetles it s safe and non toxic to humans as you simply wash it off your fruits and veggies so it would be great to stock up on this miracle powder they recommend the surround wp lb brand which has increased from to tax amp shipping research shows that this clay is refined using a super magnetic centrifuge then filters the clay particles to a critical microns in size if the granules are too large they will not be effective at irritating the little pests i m sure that if a  were to happen many people would panic into gardening from pure starvation and be clueless and not have access to resources like ultra fine kaolin clay as much as i would like to stock up i simply do not have the funds and even purchasing bag is a gouge in my budget in a  i will not have access to a super magnetic centrifuge i guess my question is how can i naturally protect my plants in a way that doesn t require a supply chain simply at home i ve watched people on youtube make homemade clay from clay containing dirt in their yard in a bucket they mix up the dirt with water to suspend the fine particles in a chocolate milk consistency and filter it what are your thoughts on taking that fine liquid then putting it into a pump sprayer and finally adding some homegrown blended mint spearmint extract as a natural repellent didn t ancient tribes use mud on their skin as a mosquito repellent this feels like a simple alternative and i m certainly going to test it on some of my affected fruit trees i d like to hear your thoughts and ideas in the comment section below thank you

1,i m buying another house for climate change help hello it s my first post here but i figured you d give me a straighter answer than other communities i m realizing things are now mostly out of my control the only thing i found i can try and do is to prepare as best as i can for the upcoming years so i ve started looking for a house outside of cities and plains because i think those zones will be the most impacted by climate change i live in italy and we are lucky enough to have many biomes in a relatively small radius also because of family i cannot go live in another part of the world at least not yet do you think there are particular criteria i should look for to mitigate what is coming in the next years so far i m looking for lowish mountains meters from sea level with underground water some land to convert to resilient crops and plants maybe permaculture i m keeping my search confined to villages that are very old because they should have been built with natural disasters protection in mind am i missing something what kind of research should i focus on is it all futile anyway thanks

1,the worst case scenario for global warming rcp tracks closely with actual emissions with scientists divided between hope and despair a new study finds that the model projecting warming of degrees celsius is actually the best choice high end projection for greenhouse gas concentrations is still the most realistic for planning purposes through at least because it comes closest to capturing the effects of both historical emissions and anticipated outcomes of current global climate policies tracking within percent of actual emissions for near term time horizons we think it s actually the best choice because it matches cumulative emissions what happened over the last years has been about exactly right compared to what was projected by rcp that holds especially true for medium term planning through on a hopeful note canadell added that the rate of carbon dioxide emissions have slowed over the last two decades didn t grow at all during the last two years and won t grow much over the coming years or longer even if we resume some growth it will be modest he said we don t know the future but we are going to be hovering at stabilization of co emissions for quite a few years up to a decade and by then renewable energy will be certainly meeting more than the excess energy demand
1,climate change is an umbrella term let s discuss all the implications of what it means i have a list of many problems climate change has been to blame for i understand humans like to categorize things into a neat little box but when a disease gets bad enough anyone of the symptoms could become a disease in and of itself my goal with this post is for us to collectively dissect the term climate change to understand all of its implications and maybe discuss how we d go about solving each sub issue here s the list i wrote it mostly off the top of my head add to it talk about it cry about how we re all gonna die but most importantly let s discuss if we re already digging our graves climate change referes to or will in directly cause current shifts ice caps melting ocean currents temperature and acidification shifts flooding to the extent thailand and nyc will be the new atlantis species die offs wildfires ozone madness please expand on this chemistry isn t my science of choice drought food shortage immigration crises leading to us vs them and in some countries loss of cultural identity while picking up toxic inclusivity the start of double speak other countries inevitably doubling down on industrial military complex goals being to enforcing police state for protection of the rich people temperature rise leads to insect growth causing pests eating crops spread of lyme disease malaria and new fun things i haven t even heard of yet tl dr climate change means many things most people are scared of defining big problems but understanding the problem is the first step to solving it what did i miss what do you think we should do

1,a new additional international financial system established by sanction countries amp asia will end the current world madness a new additional international financial system established by sanction countries amp asia will end the current world madness there is a way can easily defeat the us dollar amp the euro with a special strategy there is absolutely no way for the usa and the west to erase sanctions or have any change to end the current modern slave so it is better for all the slave nations to setup an new additional international financial system to compete with the imf all the current sanction countries such as north korea iran syria cuba venezuela etc and the asia should setup a brand new start up global financial system an example of the new one can defeat the us dollar euro is here currency rate will based on the inflation rate of each nations and be observed carefully via the other nations and only change once per week or per month the final inflation rate will be the result of average rate reported from each other member nations all nations will have to setup a new office to receive report about local government corruption and observe the inflation rates in all other nations all nations will have the new set minimum base note there will be a trading limit and restriction rule like if reach dollar per person then that nation will receive a warning if reach dollar of import goods then will not allowed to import goods any more but still allow export good the restriction will lift only your nations debt within the new system back to under dollar per person all the foreign currency exchange rate via commercial banks will use a same official rates no any additional rate and random set by each banks like the current one each nation in the new financial block will have their own rule own permission about how to deal with the other nations from the imf or any new other financial system a currency is always backed by a government and is tell you the stable and life of any nations but now if you can have a new organization like above then your national currency value will skyrocketing because it will be backed by many nations as well and via the most fair rule which is the inflation rate imagine a new financial organization with japan new china korea vietnam russia thailand malaysia myanmar mongolia which mean all the member currency will backed by over billions people and will going to crush the current us dollar backed by oil and the euro back by over billions people and that is just a small eastern asia region if including the west asia then that will be nearly billion people that is the way to defeat the us dollar amp the euro you do not need gold backed currency because the most powerful is the knowledge backed currency a new virtual invisible government with a virtual currency combine a lot of small individual currencies what a great strategy all the sanctioned nations and the asia have nothing to lose they should kick off the great life reset as long as using only knowledge to fight but not the gold physical threat like the north korea are doing then it will be perfectly ok for the west hello the asia the east if you want to this special strategy you must get the permission from me the savior first in advance best regard the savior messiah kalki maitreya buddha anyname

1,the climate defense race 
1,chaos is worst for high complexity processes a list of things that ll break first from some of these posts i get the impression that there will be a not too distant date when the government explodes and all of our civilization disappears leaving us in rd world conditions this is absurd on the first day there won t be a civil war or an epidemic outbreak i m not saying the first day will be unremarkable there ll be confusion panic and lots of uncertainty reasons below executives will switch to red alert mode and think of quick solutions for upcoming problems they ll be crude inefficient hotfixes but they ll work for a while existing high complexity processes working or failing will be seen as too risky to continue they ll be abolished or actively torn down to divert money to more immediate problems in order to get a glimpse on what will disappear from our lifestyles first i d like to make a list with the most complex solutions in our life and are very likely to break down from single element failure here s how the first day will run down the stock market opens at am with our europe and us national debts reaching a critical limit the first big investors have been pulling back in the night before creating a self propagating selling spiral in the morning our currencies inflate massively within minutes the stock market closes a few minutes later to stop the chaos international trade simply won t happen on that day everything in the next few days is a direct consequence of a d economy vulnerable quickly failing supermarkets although they rely on a central warehouse transport is so streamlined that there s virtually no storage buffer they also rely on a centralized database for shipments which can easily fail as soon there are payment issues from sudden inflation the suppliers will delay and shelves will be empty it s not that the food vanishes it s just going to take a lot of time and effort to get it to its destination international trading if you need money from paypal you suddenly realize it s actually located in scotland you can still initiate a money transfer but it won t arrive any time soon by extension bank accounts your bank needs to actively organize money if you want to deplete your deposit and that would be almost impossibly risky in a chaotic financial market they ll wait until the sea calms prepare for a very sudden minutes and quite long term freezing of your accounts mobile phone reception providers are barely equipped to handle regular phone traffic today when people realize there s no fresh food on the shelves they ll be overwhelmed within hours also network towers rely on gps for their timing regular politics bureaucracy crumples under any substantial  best case scenario local anarchy politicians work efficiently and come up with a good contingency plan within a few weeks worst case scenario martial law and military police rulership directed by non democratic departments like the nsa gps accuracy satellites depend on regular calibration from ground control at least every day cost cutting or severe power outages could mean less frequent updates drastically deteriorating receiver accuracy gas only of the us oil consumption can be covered by local production the oil import chain depends on foreign economies and distribution networks not even speaking of political influences gas is incredibly essential so it ll be a top priority for everyone after the local reserves are depleted days there ll be local shortages and probably massive price increases gas will be rare for private transport because agriculture has priority but it won t run out completely for a long time vulnerable slowly failing electricity at least in europe the electricity network has too much stability and capacity to fail immediately from financial problems nuclear fuel suppliers will be in turmoil for a while leaving only local electricity production in the us reactors seem to be more volatile for example nuclear plants can suddenly shut down during power outages adding to the disturbance gps availability satellites have a strictly limited lifespan years after which they run out of fuel and fall down to earth usually there s one launch per year combined cost m each but increasing construction and launch costs mean that satellites will fall quicker from the sky than we can replace them cheap air transport possible today only through a delicately balanced political network effective multinational coorporations a stable passenger flow and cheap oil most of those will  so no more imported foods and very long waiting times for very expensive spare parts your job worth mentioning because you ll probably keep working possibly even getting paid for quite some time there ll too be much chaos and panic in the upper rows for any decisions about human resources if you work for a very local and practical market think carpenter your job is probably safe and in rising demand the internet while the actual infrastructure is very resilient to chaotic events large companies like your internet provider aren t google and facebook rely on the most ethereal of all revenue streams on this planet advertising this game of trust breaks very easily especially during economic troubles the decline won t be obvious and they ll try to come up with new plans and strategies behind the curtains if nothing works the servers will be shut down some day all we ll realize from this page is temporarily not available is that our data is suddenly gone this is all i could think of if you too were baffled by some process in your own past because it just seemed too complicated to work just put it into the comments it probably belongs on this list

1, as scientific inquiry versus  as ideology mythology morality by focusing on politically charged rhetoric easy to use labels such as commie fascist or nazi and other such forms of tribal allegiance signaling we might be doing a disservice to the scientific and explanatory investigation of  as a complex and multifaceted process you cannot derive an ought from an is says david hume meaning to some that the way things are cannot conclude what should be done about them because that is a moral preference or choice that we make as individuals if we measure the resilience of a community even this digital one in proportion to the explanatory content it creates disseminates given that understanding the world is prioritized it would seem that all conversation that is not giving us a clearer picture of what is happening is counterproductive not because we hope to fend off death forever but because of the actual value of knowledge it is by being exposed to different viewpoints modes of thought and value systems that it becomes more likely for us to inoculate against ideology because by having more options we are forced to consider them but oftentimes the exchange of ideas that is presented is assumptive and declaratory as opposed to open ended and inquisitive our current vocabulary for political rhetoric is so limited that we project our own assumptions upon all challengers usually by identifying personally with specific perspectives of which we might not even be aware so that when our idea is attacked we feel attacked david bohm writes extensively about this problem in a pamphlet called on dialogue he is most concerned by the fact that as long as communication between individuals is antagonistic binary or motivated by ego identification with ideas we cannot break ground on new ideas how do we maintain free and open communication when it is difficult to even be aware of our own assumptions

1,is disaster capitalism driving the reticence inaction and even denial toward the rapidly accelerating climate crisis is disaster capitalism driving the reticence inaction and even denial toward the rapidly accelerating climate crisis today since early morning i d been wondering whether i should post a hypothesis on r  on whether there is a deflection point a drop point in profiteering from the growing climate crisis the shock doctrine the rise of disaster capitalism naomi klein where as you say commodities and resources become more scarce and hence rise in price while the demand stays the same or even grows with growing populations and economies in various countries however one would expect that at a point in the near future e g a couple of decades following the rise in prices and excessive profiteering and price gouging when there is a phase shift in the  process where the human societies begin their rapid descent toward anarchy wars famine displacement and death those profit making commodities would rapidly lose their customer base and the supply chains would deteriorate to such extents that they could not connect the goods to the retailers and their customers that s the point that climate crisis profiteering itself begins a death spiral the question that one could pose is whether there are numeric models that could forecast the initial upward trends and the timing of the downward turn or deflection point in profiteering from the ongoing climate crisis if such models exist one would be concerned that the reason at least in part for inaction in facing the current climate crisis by business leaders and the private sector and their political cronies in governments is that they are looking forward to collecting massive profits as competition e g a majority of smaller or medium size businesses and states in resources manufactured goods commodities and services withers and what remains will concentrate i e acquired hostile takeovers m amp a etc in the hands of powerful trusts and conglomerates

1,do you ever stop to think we deserve exactly what is coming for us i m not talking about the children who had no role in creating this mess i m not talking about the people in the unindustrialized nations either i m referring to the majority of adults in industrialized nations we can divide them into two groups the people who recognize we have a problem and the deniers some of the deniers are intellectually dishonest believing whatever fits their agenda out of cynical self interest this is most of the republican party and the corporate hierarchy that support them on the other hand some of the regular people who believe their bullshit can be forgiven because they are mentally ill the same people who deny climate change often believe it s a plot to implement a world government led by some nefarious evil agent like reptillians the rothschilds the jesuits or the zionists these tend to be people who grew up severely marginalized and as a result feel severe distrust towards the whole world they have my sympathy but most people are not deniers most people have some basic understanding of the problem the problem is not that they don t understand the problem the problems is that they fundamentally don t care they want to be popular and adjust their behavior to whatever will make them look popular and successful in the eyes of their peers try looking at the average hip liberal westerner and ask yourself what sort of sacrifice they re genuinely willing to make to ensure we avoid imposing unimaginable suffering on our own children and the people who live near the equator do these people become vegan no they take it for granted that they can eat like an apex predator in a world where there are seven billion of us if you confront them with how much land it uses or how these animals live they don t really care they learn it and then they just go on living as they re used to or try looking at how people actually treat their own carbon footprint it was recently in the news that air travel emissions around the world have grown faster than originally anticipated even according to the worst case scenarios because people have simply started flying much more than originally projected everyone is willing to travel to the other side of the world to lay on some tropical beach in a tourist resort fenced off from people who live in shacks and live on less than one dollar per day take a selfie for instagram and then fly back so what do these people do if they can afford it they ll status signal they ll buy a tesla and pretend they re solving the problem rather than simply aiming to live within their means how hard can it be to live near your workplace why are these people so weak why are they so selfish why are they so decadent they tell you that they ll be dead before it happens as if it doesn t matter that their own children inherit an apocalyptic wasteland when they re dead where is their gratitude and humility before nature even the tiniest insect with its irredescent wings is a miracle of incomprehensible proportions a product of billions of years of evolution destroyed within the blink of an eye they throw it all away they tell themselves that they will simply move to mars completely blind towards all the endless beauty that nature provides to us on a single day from every scent produced by the living soil at any moment of the day to every butterfly that dances in the wind the lack of gratitude is difficult to wrap your head around not so long ago it used to be normal in the western world to pray and thank god for your meal before eating it this places an external deity in command of the creation but at least it is a recognition that this luxury we live in is not something we should take for granted and yet today we live like medieval aristocrats people from the soviet union used to break down crying when they saw western supermarkets for the first time they imagined it must be fake and yet to us we take it for granted we see it as self evident that every luxury from every corner of the world is available to us at any moment of the day in any season people don t look at this world as a treasure as an unimaginable gift filled to the brim with life abundance and beauty people fly to the other side of the world just to lay on a tropical beach for a week and be taken care of by people born on the wrong side of capitalism i m not talking about some abstract evil man a big bellied corporate drone with a six figure salary somewhere in a corner office i m talking about the average man in the street your neighbor your cousin almost everyone takes this absurdity for granted see the world before it s gone they tell you as if they genuinely appreciate other places rather than fencing themselves off in a hyperreal perversion of nature created by capitalism where the unequal power relationship is hidden and enforced by numbers on bank accounts instead of whips and chains they tell you you re missing out utterly blind as they are to what the world has to offer their wealth and opulence reduces everything to a banality for them i live in the netherlands in bicycle distance of forests where butterflies survive that face extinction in our droughts generations of hard work was necessary to restore the heath and the forest where these butterflies survive they are now dying in the unprecedented droughts but how many people even have a clue who bothers to go out and see them before they leave our country for good within two hours i reach the estuary of our rivers above ground the seagulls gather oysters fly into the air and drop them on the stones take a dive and you encounter an underwater paradise here in the water we have sea horses jellyfish sea anemones otherworldly beauty i could not hope to properly do justice to how many people care how many people have ever even taken a dive here their friends on instagram won t care so they travel to see the great barrier reef before it s gone travel a little further and within hours i m in belgium where blind pale shrimp live in streams in underground caves what more does a person need all you need are friends and family to enjoy it with how do you wrap your head around the fact that human beings lock so many other animals in tiny cages and chop down forests to grow food to feed to these animals that the bacteria in their organs are now emitting enough methane and other greenhouses gasses to warm up the planet what does that make us a failed species pathological narcissists the kalahari bushmen run for hours after an animal until it s from exhaustion then thanks the animal for its meat and says a prayer to ensure the animal will reincarnate without remaining resentful towards them we press a button on a screen and we have an international auschwitz on our plates and we see it as our given right something we shouldn t even stop and question when you realize what we have then you realize why we don t deserve it and why we are about to lose it i just wish the proper people would end up paying the price

1,why having children may harm the planet and the child s well being the earth has a deadline september years days hours minutes and seconds the time remaining for all countries to adopt measures decisive to keep the rise in global temperature below c the time when all babies born in this second will be years old the time when climate change becomes a global threat an extinction level threat we should stop having babies we may not only let them enter a world with possibly the worst future they too will not live in a world as beautiful and colorful as ours today and will not live long either we should first consider saving our species then we will reproduce we should wait until new technology may save us from the dark future or the people will actually try to not shit on the planet that we love the planet is fine the humans are not the time when climate change becomes a huge threat what you can do
1,how to solve the problem of overpopulation and still have lots of babies i recently published a book proposing that one way to deal with our impending  is humor here s an excerpt human civilization is unsustainable and each increase of the human population is making human civilization increasingly unsustainable what few people realize or are willing to admit is that having a baby increases the human population yes that s a very controversial statement but i ve never been one to shy away from radical views in search of solutions let s say that in america we re destroying the capacity of the planet to sustain life by a factor of if that seems a bit high it s because america is much more unsustainable than the global average also i m factoring in the unsustainable use of fossil fuels if want to be sustainable and who doesn t we have a few options first option if we want to create a sustainable world and we re consuming resources times faster than they can be replenished we d have to consume times less okay who wants to sign up for the first option sound of crickets apparently that option isn t terribly popular option two the second option is to reduce the human population by a factor of in other words reduce the human population to percent of what it is now if we chose this option we wouldn t have to reduce our consumption at all if we re unsustainable by a factor of and if we reduce the population by a factor of then we can consume on an individual basis exactly as much as we re consuming right now we can drive gas guzzling cars we can be wasteful with our water and other resources we can be just as stupid as we are now okay who wants to sign up for option two sound of crickets i m surprised that option wasn t more popular usually any option that allows us to stay stupid goes over very well apparently the desire to have babies is very strong so we need another option we need an option that allows us to continue our unsustainable lifestyle and continue to have babies well there is an option that would allow it but i didn t want to bring it up before it s pretty radical option three the third option is to genetically alter ourselves to become really small such as an inch tall that way even with our current population we would use only a tiny fraction of our current resources for example cars for people an inch tall would get about miles to the gallon homes for people an inch tall would use the amount of wood contained in a few twigs a single potato would provide enough french fries for everyone in dubuque iowa we could retain our current lifestyle and keep having babies what do y all think of that option ooh yeah sign us up for that option great unfortunately we re not quite ready to proceed with that option not until a few problems are worked out for example everybody on earth would have to agree to do it because if anybody stayed at our current size they would be huge godzilla type monster humans that could step on the rest of us the other problem would be with other forms of life that remained at their current size for people one inch tall encountering a beetle would mean a life or death struggle family picnics would be ruined by crows swooping down to carry children back to their nest so option three unfortunately is not feasible unless we exterminate every form of life on this planet except for humanity we re working on this as hard as we can but it might take a few years excerpted from we re doomed a humorous exploration of humanity s war against life

1,shower thought  is only sudden for the uninformed masses i wanted to give my own thoughts on when  might happen and truthfully i think i have an idea for people to chew on first i think  happens for people at different points for quite a few people  of the ego happened during this very pandemic where they became disillusioned with the world and society we live in for most people however they think that now that the vaccines have been rolled out they can go back to normal good triumphs evil etc you ve all likely seen at least one person in your life who is in this stage still where they willingly bury their head in the sand and treat you as a pessimist so where am i going with this i think that this group say about of the bell curve will be the final determinant of  when they too lose all faith in the system i think that will be the point that  will happen the system which we currently live in only exists because the vast majority of people still believe it exists and for no other reason people will continue to believe they can return to a state of normal of denying the atrocities of the world right until the moment that they can t what will be the catalyst for such a large amount of people losing faith in the system i think the critical juncture is either the externalization of the coming of the end times think the sea people from the bronze age  or the degredation and destruction of the power grid it is large enough in scale highly centralized a localized enough threat that people will pay attention and easy enough to destroy by people or natural forces natural disasters are now breaking records on the regular and each time one happens you can see another pop in the support pillars of this country all it would take is a major natural disaster say a megafire that envelops the entire great plains lots of kindling there or a nationwide heatwave coinciding with brownouts blackouts or the current government simply hiding from its people during a famine power outage for the shit to collectively hit the fan for those who are aware before it s too late  is a process for those who don t know or willingly refuse to know  is a grand catostrophic event be thankful you were able to open yourself up to this possibility and get the chance to either prepare a gun or prepare some popcorn for what will unfold soon enough

1,question 
1,global warming believers are nazis says investment banker just found lurking in a dark corner of the internet gt if you look at what the nazis were doing in the s in their environmental policies virtually every theme you see in the modern environmental movement the nazis were doing said rupert darwall author of green tyranny in a recent interview with encounter books gt gt i think actually the most extraordinary thing that i came across was this quote from adolf hitler where he told an aide once i m not interested in politics i m interested in changing people s lifestyles well that could be that s extraordinarily contemporary that is what the modern environmental movement is all about it s about changing people s lifestyles said darwall who is no crackpot on the fringe and whose background includes duties as a special advisor to the united kingdom s chancellor of the exchequer gt gt the fuhrer s interest in changing people s lifestyles is not at all shockingly similar to the goals of today s climate fanatics who want to destroy capitalism and replace it with an economic system run by them naturally that would certainly change lifestyles in the west gt gt darwall further notes in the interview that the nazis were the first political party in the world to have a wind power program and were also opposed to eating meat a delightful and nutritious activity that the warming alarmists consider a sin
1,an offer of unsolicited advice in one possible version of the  i know many if not most of you feel animosity towards religious people i understand this and i don t want to harp on about it instead i want to offer one of the possible versions of the  for you it is if it happens for me it is when many of the signs are confusing at best so i ll stick with the most obvious ones here i m doing this because i sincerely care about your eternal future and i don t really care about karma upvotes if any of you read this in cynicism it is my hope that one or two sticks with you and makes itself obvious to you in time that you might get religion in time before the really bad parts start happening here are the indicators of the christian end many of which have been fulfilled so i ll indicate those rebuilding of the jewish temple in jerusalem the greatest and most obvious sign before the rapture this will be enormous news for anyone unfamiliar with the politics of it it will take someone crazy like trump forcing it down palestinian muslim throats in jerusalem the ability to annihilate all human life on earth i don t think i need to explain this one to anyone here it s been fulfilled a hundredfold jewish people having their own homeland back fulfilled for the most part the ability of instant transmission of images audio video fulfilled obviously the gospel must be preached throughout the whole world some people would say this has been fulfilled i disagree there are certain uncontacted tribes in the amazon and at least one island near india that has remained uncontacted but there are certain efforts being made to change that against the wishes of many anthropological societies breaking the first six of the seven seals this includes the blood moon the stars falling from the sky the great earthquake every mountain and island moved out of their places the sky is split up and unfurled like a scroll ozone layer maybe all the people of earth hiding and trembling because of the wrath of god nature rebelling famines pestilence disease etc this one is one of the more difficult ones as it has alot of things that are obvious red moons sun eclipse meteor showers earthquakes that make mountains islands move because they happen almost literally all the time but maybe they are different or just already fulfilled and will continue to cycle while the rest of the signs catch up the antichrist this guy alot of people you and me or you or me are going to think this dude is awesome he s gonna fix our problems he s going to bring peace to the middle east and an ailing europe america and everyone is going to believe he is a messiah a peace bringer the chosen one he is going to go to the new temple at jerusalem and say something along the lines of i am god the messiah i m willing to have a conversation with anyone about this like i said i understand your skepticism but i value your soul your eternity too much to just say do your own thing hope you don t end up in hell as some kind of laissez faire christian i know most of you will downvote as an immediate knee jerk but just read the list still and if when you see these things grab a bible to see what jesus said
1,just a temporary illusion amp xb i saw an odd rhetorical question spray painted on the back of a trailer as i drove threw flagstaff az recently numerous civilizations before us have fallen from ecological suicide so it seems that no amount of technological advancement or scientific awareness can prevent us from repeating the same mistake over and over in fact our technology has only increased a thousand fold our ability to consume nature allowing us to transgress planetary boundaries and not mere geographic localities david wallace wells in his book the uninhabitable earth says the following global warming carries a message more concerning still that we didn t defeat the environment at all there was no final conquest no dominion established in fact the opposite whatever it means for the other animals on the planet with global warming we have unwittingly claimed ownership of a system beyond our ability to control or tame in any day to day way but more than that with our continued activity we have rendered that system only more out of control nature is both over as in past and all around us indeed overwhelming us and punishing us this is the major lesson of climate change which it teaches us almost daily and if global warming continues on anything like its present track it will come to shape everything we do on the planet from agriculture to human migration to business and mental health transforming not just our relationship to nature but to politics and to history and proving a knowledge system as total as modernity mr wallace wells appears naively optimistic that any semblance of civilization will be able to function outside of the relatively stable holocene epoch within which all civilizations and modern man have developed surely he does not understand that the cascading extinctions and unraveling ecosystems upon which billions depend for food pollination clean water waste removal oxygen production etc will put mankind s very existence at risk perhaps our ultimate lesson is that we are part of nature and any dominion over it we thought we had was just a temporary illusion

1,no return to normal now when the vaccinations have arrived well at least to very limited part of population people are talking about how close is the return to normal in my homecountry people are already booking flights for the summer and everybody is acting like the whole covid crisis will be a thing of the past once enough people are vaccinated but currently only less than have received it most people will have vaccination during early summer if everything goes as planned it s almost ridiculous to see how blindly people believe in vaccines don t get me wrong here i m not some crazy anti vaxxer but it isn t even sure if vaccines are good against different mutations of the virus the long term effects of vaccines are still unknown it might very well be that soon there is some form of vaccine resistant strain of virus and all the vaccines aren t worth anything imagine the panic it would cause people are clinging to the irrational hope that vaccines make problems go away but in reality there is no return to normal not during next summer or after it covid has also destroyed the economy of multiple countries and mass unemployment is more than likely the real crisis might just be ahead current moment shows how hooked people are on the consumerist neoliberal capitalism nothing matter except the normal this is why there won t be any radical mass movements almost nobody really wants to get rid of capitalism actually abolishing it would mean that the normal would be totally gone and that scares the shit out of people the absence of capitalist reality is something people are even more afraid than the pandemic or isolation it s like stockholm syndrome people have fallen in love with their oppressors the corporate boot turns them on i almost wish that the pandemic would destroy everything that it would cause so much damage that the global capitalism would  i hate the idea of returning to normal i rather have the chaos of  that would be progress everybody who has read any history knows that really change comes from disasters and wars that is what the world needs a real crisis that would wipe away the old world once and for all good thing is that we might just get that
1,serious question why didn t the devastation of world war two or the effects of the s great depression caused global societal  societies are complex systems in theory the more complex and inter dependent a system is the more vulnerable it is to  this can be applied to human organizations that are very complex systems such a companies or civilizations but i noted that large and very complex systems tend to be more resilient than small ones coming from an asian society i do wonder if contemporary views of societal  tend to be western centric while over at east asia a long view of history shows that there is a cycle of  and recovery compare for instance large global mncs with the large number of small start ups in various sectors like information technologies as well as f amp b that appear and quickly disappear the same thing happened after the devastation of europe during world war two or the former ussr member states after the fall of communism in each case the  was quickly absorbed by the larger global economy and while the local impacts were and the decline in living standards was apparent it was short on the order of a single lifetime and it seems clear that global economic progress more than absorbed the shock in the medium term
1,i m curious how many folks here believe we ll reach c of warming from pre industrial levels by i want to be clear on something i m using the data to try and formulate my own predictions don t take what i say as factual i have without a doubt made a mistake somewhere please by all means correct me if you see something off i m formulating this prediction based on how i read the data it s not to say it s fully accurate i m sure we ve all heard the line we have years to solve climate change before we hit that c now the problem is most people including myself don t really understand the data presented by the ipcc i believe the years left to solve climate change came from this data which was severely misrepresented the data estimates on average we should reach c warming by best case we avoid c all together and worst case we reach c by the issue is it s a common conesus among the public and even folks here that c by is guaranteed i m going to try and explain why i don t think that s the case while i personally believe we ll reach c before the intended goal i do not believe we ll reach c by which as of right now is years away as per nasa verified results suggest we are currently c above pre industrial levels as of so when data is released later it will be higher most likely according to ncdc data since temperatures have been rising per decade but since have more than doubled to per decade it will most likely be a higher rate per decade as of if anyone knows the current rates i d love to know i can t find anything on it since it s the current rate of warming per decade is most likely c which means by we should reach c which is c short of the intended c mark now by or the rates of which we increase should likely decrease due to efforts by global climate pledges but regardless we should reach c by this is what i ve gather from the data i ve read by all means give your input but from what i see reaching c by is extremely unrealistic not trying to mislead anyone this is just the picture of what i m seeing from the data i d love to be corrected and understand better amp xb i made this post as i ve noticed a lot of folks here are convinced that we will die in years or that we ll reach these levels of warming in such short notice to in years at a rate of c per decade doesn t quite add up

1,the idea we get to choose our future is a farce regardless of who wins the government is controlled by the deep state all this hillary vs trump shit is rearranging deck chairs on the titanic just a reminder that this election doesn t really matter the israel first deep state will still try and overthrow the syrian government and the domestic situation will continue to deteriorate just the same path we ve been on for years now all the media emphasis on these two candidates is to make you look away from what s happening in syria right now and ignore that the government itself has been almost completely taken over by banking and military industrial interests this election is akin to an abuser letting you have the choice between getting punched in the gut or slapped in the face and then making you think you did it after it happens you chose this they will say as they continue to destroy the middle class at least the other person didn t win can you imagine how bad it would ve been if that had happened trying to make you feel lucky and blessed as we are being looted good cop bad cop look at the right hand so you don t see what the left is doing it s psychological manipulation of the highest order it s a distraction they are playing a trick on us so we think the important thing is the election and that we have genuine choice we don t they own our political system they own our media until this deep corruption is addressed choosing our political figurehead means next to nothing it s a gold star we put on top of a pile of shit real revolution comes from self empowerment through awakening to the reality of things not from a single binary choice you make once every years i know you know this but everyone needs a reminder once in a while it s easy to get caught up in the emotionally charged propaganda that is seeping out of every media pore but keep your eye on the big picture even if it makes you feel alone to do so you are not alone the more that wake up the more that will join and someone has to pave the road for newcomers we are here don t get distracted by mirages created by the media keep your eye on the ball
1,america gerontocracy and covid we re still currently in the first wave of covid which means that the acceleration in new cases due to lockdown restrictions going away in the us will only be significantly compounded when the second wave hits in the fall face value that s a bad thing but for the world it might actually be a great thing from the outside america seems to be a fiscal gerontocracy could also be argued that america is an economic dictatorship which means that the ones that will suffer mostly from death due to covid will be the ruling class and their voting base which in turn means there s a possibility for real change in america and by extension the world anyone else feel that no matter how terrible loss of life is it could be a good thing for the world as a whole if a lot of the fox viewership ultimately croaked along with mitch mcconnel pelosi et al
1,living standards for of the world s population will sink to the mean the mean would be like the middle class of say manila philippines some people think those who cannot create enough economic value should not live the lifestyle they have but should live like beggars and that s probably going to happen as economic growth stalls and the higher paying jobs disappear the decline of mcdonald s shows that food for the mass is now losing steam people want more quality if they could pay for it the world no longer needs middle class their middle level consumption only takes a few percents of the actual size of economy much less the poorer class it is time to reallocate the world s resources to those who are most likely to advance civilization to the next level otherwise the world will hit an iceberg around and eternal darkness will reign

1,devil s advocate i m curious what does the r  hivemind think about links and stories like these i tend to view them with skepticism but i have friends that share them so regularly it makes it hard to sort through the noise and find the truth are things truly getting worse on the whole or are they really getting so much better in areas we choose to ignore that on the whole things are actually getting better who is right
1, going mainstream topic of  coping and prepping has begun to be talked about by youtubers we can all agree how difficult it is to broach the topic of  to the average person even online within the comment section of literally any news about faster and worse than expected degradation in various parts of the world people still tend to dismiss and deny imagine my surprise when my wife told me one of the youtuber she follows was talking about  kelly stamps a typical influencer who usually vlogs about her apartment hunting shopping hauls and misadventures in the city is suddenly talking about  in her video here around the mark how do i say this without being canceled i feel like humanity has gone off into the deep end recently there s this signal that s been ringing in my head my spirit my gut my trachea my ovaries whatever it is it s tingling and telling me something bad is coming there s some sinister shift going on in the world right now coming from a run of the mill vlogger who never talks about this kind of thing and telling her audience you know what i m talking about well it definitely gave my wife and i goosebumps she then went on how to be independent and sustainable find fertile land and own a homestead grow food find a community learn skills be prepared so that i won t get for lack of a better word screwed it felt strange to see  actually going this far into the consciousness of the masses outside of reddit perhaps  going mainstream should be a new flair now because of it gaining traction and getting talked about more recently

1,a retrospective on days later i watched it last night for the first time in years and it was truly an experience watching it now as a mid s guy in gives it an entirely different context than when i was and thought it was just some cool edgy movie about the apocalypse that reignited the zombie genre it is absolutely bleak and unforgiving and it fits perfectly with what is happening in the world right now and the feelings we all have about our inevitable future that is just around the corner that sense of nothing being secure and scrounging for anything you can use to prop yourself up there s no action there s no adventure there s no other story line to follow it s nothing but doubt and uncertainty and it just goes from one sketchy desperate situation to the next with a few brief moments of reprieve in between that and obviously the virus aspect playing a central role in the movie as well as in our lives now from the opening sequence of the infected monkeys being set free and how that kind of parallels what happened with covid how quickly it took over the world and brought everything to a halt the continued effort by the survivors to not get exposed how you can t trust even those closest to you and once they get infected you immediately have to protect yourself from them even frank s death impacted me in a way that it never had in previous viewings the virus the  it doesn t differentiate who it impacts especially given the sense of absolute dread you feel as the other three are being driven into the military encampment and how it doesn t feel hopeful at all even though it s supposed to and the scene where jim sees the jet flying overhead is like watching the rich go on about their lives while everybody is left to suffer and fend for themselves and there s nothing we can do to change that the background music is also an important aspect to establishing the mood and atmosphere of the movie which also goes right along with being perfectly fitting for this was different from other apocalypse virus zombie movies we don t get to see shirtless will smith running on a treadmill and interacting comically with mannequins at the video store there s no weekly adventure with handsome rugged men who do interviews about it afterwards there s no comedy duo that makes just the right jokes at just the right times to make us all feel at ease it s not some scientific depiction of a real world event where we can watch it and say oh my gersh that s totally happening right now and feel smart about it afterwards days later is truly prophetic in capturing the sheer emptiness and vastness of  it made me genuinely sad for the future that s coming to all of us in fact after this viewing i m in favor of the alternate ending where jim dies and the two women are seen walking out of the hospital because that seems like a more natural ending to the movie not the optimistic happy ending which i admit was a little jarring after spending the previous two hours in the mindset i described
1,god do i hate being right all the time dr malcolm jurassic park for a very long time i ve felt and known that industrial civilization is doomed to fail and likely to do so in my lifetime i m i ve had discussions with friends and family over the years and the childish optimism of people i ve learned is not a sincerely held belief but more of a coping mechanism for the masses the future can be seen as two different paths for most people one is where we all buckle down launch the wwii scale mobilization needed to defeat climate change develop sustainable economies by mimicking nature s zero waste cycles the other is some kind of children of men mad max walking dead type future where the facade of progress is lifted for all and we trudge along in a doomed system cause there is no other way to have an okay life but year after year my predictions which just are stepping stones along the second path come true of course trump will damage democracy and american politics of course we won t curtail climate change of course species extinction will continue once we know we will pass degc warming mainstream studies now saying this we are going to have to start talking in the mainstream about which parts of the planet civilization will be able to survive on long term canada and scandinavia will start to become where people want to be for years my predictions have come true which is why i m not having kids i m vegan i eschew materialism as much as i can because it just feels so wasteful everything is going to get way way worse in the future will be looked at as a pretty decent year compared to what s coming

1,i m rob mielcarski ask me anything my favorite questions begin with why good morning i m looking forward to an interesting discussion with you this tweet verifies my identity you can read a bit about my background here many people think and write about what is going on my little niche at un denial com is to collect the best ideas from minds much greater than mine and to synthesize them into explanations for why things are the way they are for example why does life exist why is photosynthesis amazing why did it take billion years for complex life to emerge why do all billion of us descend from one small tribe in africa why have no other species evolved human intelligence why are humans the only species that believes in life after death why are most humans capable of understanding almost anything except their own overshoot why do most of our famous intellectuals and leaders not have a clue what is going on why do we collectively discuss everything except what matters why do we never discuss the one thing that would improve our future population reduction why should we be happy to be alive today amp xb i believe that if you want to improve something you must being with an understanding of why it is the way it is and even if it is impossible to change something there is great personal satisfaction in using our rare brain to understand why i hope that we can spend some time today on the why questions
1,heres my guess on how i will think itll end i think two things will kick start it either global warming or some super virus no matter what one it is the rich will all flee to mars thanks to elon musk investing into it heavily if not mars itll be bunkers under the ground the common folk ie blue collar workers etc will just be left behind governments will  and eventually people will form their own groups of sorts and itll be a war for supplies if its not that then itll just be some nuclear war for oil
1,the future of human evolution after the  of civilization part knowing what happens to the biosphere we live in allows us to make some predictions about the future world that we will inhabit the most important point to understand is the following authority will be rare and little contrary to what we believe modern humans spend far more time ordered around than our ancestors medieval peasants spent a minority of their time working for their lord and most of the time worked on their own land in total they spent less time working than modern humans the reason for this is obvious authority is inefficient in an ant colony order exists without authority because the most efficient system is one in which every organism does what it enjoys the most societies based around authority are inefficient and are either destroyed from within or destroyed by more efficient outside societies modern society is incredibly inefficient but we get away with this as a result of our large fossil fuel subsidies as our society revolves around being paid to do things we do not want to do humans spend much of their time pretending to be working humans also spend much of their time doing surrogate work in an attempt to be able to receive jobs that they do like when they grow up hence we see trends like unpaid interns although we need plenty of people to clean toilets and work in factories most people don t want to do so and hence spend their lives competing for access to the few jobs that are fun politics entertainment technology also has the effect of reducing the proportion of jobs that are fun as an example in a society with little transportation and communications we need a larger number of musicians and journalists than we currently do making a shoe or a chair by yourself is more fun than operating the machines that make thousand identical shoes and chairs per day the reason authority is necessary in our society is because people will voluntarily work for kin that also provide services in return while only force will cause us to work for people unrelated to us the reason we have to work for people unrelated to us is because technology causes centralization and the destruction of natural communities not a single species besides the human species practices authority it is true that dogs for example have alpha dogs that are the only ones in their group that breed but other dogs in the pack voluntarily chose not to breed and do not suffer from this because the alpha dog is closely genetically related to them hence in the future communities will again be based more around voluntary cooperation than around competition humans will be more feminine than they currently are the evolution of the human race represents the evolution from masculinity to femininity female chimpanzees are more muscular and hairy than human males even compared to our hunter gatherer ancestors our muscles are small humans sacrificed their strong jaw to be able to grow a brain large enough to survive in our modern world the reason humans will be more feminine is because cooperation is a more efficient survival strategy than competition as mentioned earlier this is especially so under agriculture this leads to the spread of female traits because women are more dependent upon cooperation than men during pregnancy women are vulnerable to predators and poorly able to autonomously gather food and hence are dependent upon allies for this reason women are inherently more social than men male communication revolves more around sharing information that benefits our survival while female communication revolves more around communicating for the sole purpose of forming social bonds hence when women talk about problems to men they are simply seeking to form social bonds while men are simply seeking to respond with solutions agriculture requires cooperation because during short periods of the year a large amount of work is required that a single individual can not accomplish by himself harvesting and sowing are for example short periods that require a large amount of work while large parts of the year have no work and are hence known to us as holiday seasons this compares to hunter gatherer life which requires a fairly equal amount of work throughout the year and can be provided by individual humans in agricultural societies intelligence is a very important trait because intelligence enables cooperation and the formation of strong social bonds to the exclusion of others intelligence is less required in many not all hunter gatherer societies where tool use is not absolutely essential and where it is possible to hunt animals by simply chasing them to exhaustion a large amount of land on our planet will always be unfit for agriculture and will hence only be populated by hunter gatherer tribes however the majority of humans will always live in agricultural societies because agriculture enables far higher population densities intelligence will hence be a trait that will be maintained throughout the human gene pool the ability to entertain and manipulate people is an ability that requires high intelligence and is most useful in agricultural societies the future of human reproduction polygyny one man having multiple wives as found in certain cultures is a temporary trend in many countries it is capable of rapidly increasing intelligence by allowing a minority of the most intelligent men to gather all women at the cost of everyone else the downside of polygyny is that genetic diversity rapidly declines every generation only a minority of men pass down their genes to the next generation hence causing a decline in genetic diversity which is very important under high population density because disease spreads rapidly in agricultural societies when compared to other methods of food production polyandry will always exist to a certain degree but will not become very widespread because it spreads sexually transmittable diseases that cause infertility that can not be treated without antibiotics polyandry will however be the most popular reproductive strategy amongst hunter gatherers where everyone will be able to freely mate with one another as under low population density and small isolated tribes sexually transmittable diseases will be rare and limited in number the most widespread form of mating will be the ones that maximize genetic diversity while keeping the spread of sexually transmittable diseases relatively low the most popular reproductive strategy will be serial monogamy serial monogamy is the western reproductive pattern under serial monogamy people spend a few years with one partner these few years can be extended if children are born to allow the father to help raise them eventually the two partners grow bored of each other and both find new partners with whom to raise another litter sexual behavior that encourages cooperation will become more likely examples are attraction to the same gender which is very common amongst non human bonobos homosexuality is likely rare amongst humans when compared to bonobo s because amongst humans it was punished with the death penalty under many religions it is known that amongst the romans bisexuality was widespread with heterosexual roman emperors being a minority besides sexual attraction to the same gender romantic attraction to the same gender will likely become very common as it will encourage humans to be able to sacrifice themselves for those related to them homosexuality manages to survive in our species because homosexuals increase the number of children that are born to their relatives as an example directly observable to us homosexual men understand better than heterosexual men what makes a man attractive and hence are capable of increasing the reproductive success of their male friends and siblings human speciation speciation benefits an organism because a lack of reproduction between two groups means that sexually transmittable diseases do not spread between them and furthermore every sub group can maintain genes that are only useful for that specific group as an example the sickle cell gene is only useful to people exposed to malaria amongst humans speciation will also occur unless we rapidly go extinct which is unlikely there are various ways by which speciation can occur but the most important for humans will be assortative mating assortative mating means that individuals only mate with other individuals that are similar to them over time this separates a species into two groups because individuals that fall between two stereotypes and have intermediate characteristics will be unattractive to either as an example amongst humans being an average musician and an average military leader doesn t increase your reproductive success while being excellent at either and horrible at the other does one form of speciation that is likely is speciation due to a difference in intelligence it is already known that the most important factor to intelligent people in a mate is intelligence and people in relationships have comparable levels of intelligence hence humans will split into different species not because we are isolated from each other but because we will find each other disgusting humans are naturally intolerant to people who are different from them and it takes strong social conditioning to teach people to tolerate people from other groups this current trend of tolerance will be temporary and in the future different groups will avoid conflict between each other by isolating themselves from one another hence humans will continue to dominate large areas of the planet but we will not be the homogeneous blob that we currently represent neoluddite federation of europe

1,growing economy economies of scale decreasing product diversity this post is much less unrelated to  economics than it may seem it s my observation over years of how growth assumptions built into computing drive unhealthy trends computing as an industry is growing but product diversity is reducing due to a continuous trend of integration two devices become two modules become two chips become two dies becomes two areas on the same silicon die this seems to have enormous positive feedback effects bringing electronics closer means lower cost and lower latency this makes flexibility the victim forcing greater cost for multiple variants most prospective customers needs are within a range computer makers focus on the most densely clustered subset thus the product targets them perfectly this makes other customers who were not targeted subject to higher costs for acquiring what they want since flexibility is lesser this encourages the fringe customers to give up their esoteric needs and join the mainstream further driving up costs for the remaining fringe buyers improving performance requires ever increasing capital costs which is usually amortized over an ever larger base of customers these new customers have not yet differentiated their needs and thus aren t getting a chance to go to the fringe this makes it unattractive to release any fringe features to attract the fringe customers because it might harm the much larger mainstream and new customers companies following this trend get very big and start cutting out middlemen to squeeze more profits middlemen vendors don t have much to do anyway when pretty much everything is integrated onto one board or chip middlemen vendors engineering custom features requires expensive engineers and designers who are all also tempted to join the manufacturer itself customers also demand reliability because they use it for other economic purposes diverse hardware is the enemy of reliability and the reason customers demand reliability is because they are using it for other economy growing activities so they will pay a large premium to any company producing reliable and locked down hardware this of course starves the middlemen vendors of revenue which instead goes to the manufacturer integrating everything there s a thread i started on r hardware for reference containing more technical views on this what if memory controller and pcie controller were not integrated on cpu this may help others in seeing the larger but subtle picture of how several things come together to make nongrowth steady state degrowth look impossible horrible dangerous rather than rational
1,overshoot and industrial civilization are inherently good the function of life is to propagate the gene there is no other function groups that do not overshoot die where are the northern americans or the australians siberians they are all extinct or close to it what about the agricultural south americans their genetic legacy still lives on through the entire southern half of the western hemisphere and it s because they parttook in overshoot via neolithic agriculture the even further overshot civilizations of india china europe and africa are even more cosmopolitan in distribution when  hits there will still be plenty of these swarm groups left the europeans in particular are very widely distributed the others will still have more tech and resources allowing them to dominate the sparsely populated traditional sustainable groups overshoot necessitates  it also permits the decimation of competition during the transient period this is why overshoot is good despite the immense amounts of suffering that it will bring
1,another catastrophic industrial explosion today this time in germany seems like there are several a week now an additional harbinger of  or confirmation bias creeping in feels like shit is blowing up left and right out there my intuition is telling me that factors such as worker apathy burnout increased output demands and stress on increasingly complex infrastructure ever increasing bureaucratic bloat and natural disasters are pushing factories to breaking points anyone with knowledge in this area care to share what they think is going on

1,my review of this changes everything i intended this as a comment to the this changes nothing post but that vanished before i could submit i agreed with that obvious title and having recently read this changes everything will offer a review that may be found more suitable for discussion klein does not view the leading climate deniers as deluded she sees them as having made a cynical choice to protect the fossil fuel industry at all costs confident that the full disaster will not unfold in their lifetimes she excoriates the mainstream environmental groups for being cronies and lackeys of industry an accusation that some make against her i found her chapters on the false prophets of billionaire philanthropy and the non solution of geo engineering of particular interest those astute points along with klein s effective writing style are among the book s merits klein is honest in her motivations she is of a democratic socialist orientation has been late in fully understanding the looming climate disaster but now sees in it the opportunity of killing two birds with one stone conservatives have long accused the environmental movement of precisely this watermelons are green on the outside but red within and this returns to her first point that climate deniers unlike the general population fully understand what is at stake however for me the ideological equation should be the reverse to paraphrase lincoln if we can preserve the biosphere without abolishing capitalism we should do that but if market mechanisms are running to its destruction then we must take an alternative path klein proposes that we must turn the fossil fuel companies into public utilities reasoning that we must leave most of their fossil energy assets in the ground while applying the profits accrued from burning our remaining carbon rations to the transition into renewable energy she asserts that this carbon free future is achievable on a short time scale a faith that seems inspired by a single academic study concurrent with this transition the left can achieve every item on its agenda and complete social gender and ethnic equality will reign over the planet kumbaya forever and ever this is but a mild exaggeration her goals how is this to be done apparently the new model is the abolitionist movement with media events and protests reminiscent of occupy wall street they will block specific corporate projects and rally a great democratic movement to the cause she does offer some practical examples most prominently the legal actions that first nations are taking to halt the construction of infrastructure for the export of oil from tar sands but that strategy may not be applicable beyond canada i view klein as the harriet beecher stowe of this neo abolitionist movement with her book and movie as its uncle tom s cabin gt and let s take for granted that we want to do these radical things democratically and without a bloodbath so violent vanguardist revolutions don t have much to offer in the way of road maps page before returning the book i transcribed that quote because i found it to be na ve as a member of the soft left klein takes care to separate her anti capitalism from that of the marxist leninist maoist past on meeting mrs stowe in the midst of the war between the states lincoln is to have said so you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war maybe so but that struggle was concluded by a nation in arms by the brutal wills of lincoln grant sherman and sheridan i have no confidence in klein s road map there will be blood

1,modern system is too robust and too stable for a fast  instead a jenga style downsizing will occur modern system is almost murderously efficient the split nanosecond nature of the financial industry has permeated into every step of human endeavor and the world has gotten too efficient to be destablized by a less foreseen event because solutions to counter it or at least manage it can be found very quickly for virtually all problems the cheap oil is gone but economy will readjust to embrace those who can afford the expensive oil with some sprinkling of renewable energy and will drop those who can t afford them the can can be kicked farther and farther until we reach the technical point which will completely change the nature of game and most importantly debt can increase at least times from where we stand now because the slack has been so great one by one the periphery will be abandoned and elites in these regions will move to the core areas where civilization will continue and the slack civilization can absorb without collapsing is surprisingly large thanks to a lot of redundancy planning done earlier in anticipation of nuclear war i think that by merciless triaging and ultra draconian control in the core  can be averted until or so in the core area constantinople lasted for years venice lasted from early middle ages till napoleon and san marino founded in ce never fell and survived mussolini and world war although it did behave well enough to not draw the ire of the fascists and the allies it won t be pretty but mankind is very adaptable and can be very ruthless when their own skin is at stake so it will probably be the course civilization will take

1,is there a  scenario where running to the hills or migrating to a rural setting might be the worst thing you can do so you ve read about  watched a few youtube videos and read about the major factors of  pollution population and automation usually your gut reaction is a low intensity fight or flight response you look around at everyone doing their usual daily routine and you see people trapped in a rat race that is part of a machine that is destroying the planets ecosystem sooner or later you will think you want out of the rat race and the idea of running away to some rural sustainable solution will pop up what if running to the hills turns out to be the wrong way to go think about how  scenarios could unfold that would make a rural setting a bad idea for instance weather patterns change and the region you moved to is hit by drought look at what happened in the s dust bowl extreme weather events devastate your remote region and due to other events help is slow to arrive look at katrina the thing is any rural region on the planet is completely at the whim of mother nature the very same angry lady that is getting hot under the collar about climate change it may seem counter intuitive but cities are our attempt to make a stable set of living arrangements for ourselves that can withstand weather and the ravages of nature a city tends to rely on not one plot of land but many to keep it s population fed it s totally counter intuitive but depending on how climate change unfolds could a city be a better lifeboat than a small rural community when rome crumbled over decades did the outer rural regions  to bandits and lawlessness first or the central city although not all cities are created equal just as the centre of rome as the power base probably held out longer than some other outlier cities or will the cities with the most politicians get the best emergency military responses in times of crises even if you survive and thrive in a rural setting how long before the local  warlord or chieftain turns up and offers you protection for food through most of history rural communities were peasant farmers with local towns forts ruling over their region

1,how fast can we replace fossil fuels with renewable energy this was from the debate but seems relevant to both subs as a general discussion team realists one of the main themes running through all of the r  debaters opening statements seems to be that they don t think we can install renewable energy fast enough to make any difference when we ask experts how long will it take to replace fossil fuels some say it could happen relatively quickly andrew blakers and matthew stocks of australian national university believe the world is on track to reach renewable energy by now that is just a little over years according to their scientific predictions but some areas will be harder to electrify and that is where green hydrogen from renewable energy comes in as it will be used to replace diesel ng and blue hydrogen from fossil fuels for hard to electrify segments like trains ships and planes and for making steel and other manufacturing that requires very high constant heat most people don t understand what green hydrogen is and when they hear hydrogen they think hindenburg and explosions but the fact is we have been using hydrogen for over years and has been primarily used as a feed stock for making fertilizer and chemical bass and we don t store hydrogen in big balloons these days and we use very safe storage tanks that are designed to withstand impacts and bullets and collisions until recently all of that hydrogen was coming from fossil fuels natural gas and that is called blue hydrogen and the problem with that steam process is it still releases co and the drilling and fracking for ng still releases methane which is x worse as a green house gas green hydrogen was not being used because it is more expensive and requires a lot of electricity and it uses electrolyzers that until recently were not vey efficient that has all changed now now we are making green hydrogen from excess renewable energy and solar and wind power produce massive amounts of energy and when demand is low they have to be idled because there has been no use for that energy but now it will be used for making green hydrogen that will replace diesel ng and blue hydrogen for many uses and because it is coming from basically free excess power that would have to be idled it can compete with those other fuels and as we expand renewable energy it will just keep getting cheaper this is just a few of the green hydrogen projects in the works green hydrogen the fuel of the future set for fold expansion more than billion worth of green hydrogen projects have been announced globally in the past nine months in total more than gigawatts of such projects are in development green hydrogen could achieve cost parity with blue hydrogen by in regions with good access to renewable resources and by in additional locations renewable energy is replacing nuclear the other benefit we are seeing from renewable energy is it is so cheap and fast to build that we can now decommission old nuclear plants and phase out nuclear over time there are lots of reasons we need to get off nuclear energy nuclear is times more expensive than solar or wind takes billions in up front costs many years to build has security and safety issues and relies on a finite resource that will run out nuclear power is now the most expensive form of generation except for gas peaking plants the latest edition of the world nuclear industry status report where our uranium comes from companies that are planning new nuclear units are currently indicating that the total costs including escalation and financing costs will be in the range of kw to kw or between billion and billion for each mw plant levelized cost of energy analysis by lazard according to the nea identified uranium resources total million metric tons and an additional million metric tons remain undiscovered a roughly year supply at today s consumption rate in total that is at current consumption and if we doubled nuclear we would have less than a years we also need to get off nuclear because that demand for uranium is driving the nuclear weapons agenda and the same enrichment plants that produce the uranium fuel for nuclear plants also produces it for nuclear weapons and if we want to stop terrorists and evil people from making a nuclear weapon or dirty bomb we need to stop that enrichment renewable energy will continue to replace coal natural gas diesel and nuclear and that is already happening at a rapid pace fifty coal fired power plants have shut in the united states since president donald trump came to office two years ago according to the u s nuclear regulatory commission as of november there were shut down commercial nuclear power reactors at sites in various stages of decommissioning summary the big picture is renewable energy will allow us to finally get off fossil fuels and nuclear energy that relies on finite resources that will run out and pollutes the environment and kills people and replace it with free energy from the sun wind and water that is the big picture we want and you should join us

1,this documentary on venezuela clearly demonstrates that hyperinflation isn t really so bad so yes there s a drop in the standard of living but everyone in the video looks healthy there s no holocaust victim looking folks lining up along the streets to get some government food people are still working the city is still bustling no fires etc economic  really doesn t seem too bad just have some smart investments and stockpile food and you ll be just fine sure there s a little bit more violent crime but that s to be expected probably a good idea to carry a firearm and not let your attractive women take a taxi into the city to party but other than that just don t be stupid and the economic  may not be too bad the major difference between valenzuela and the us is that people here in the usa are far less mentally prepared if something like this were to happen in the usa people would really freak the hell out they re just far too naive stupid and entitled to handle such a large drop in the standard of living after a few months though most of the chaos will die down and we ll be back to normal just with a massive reduction in our standard of living

1,when will climate change be used as a reason for war is it possible that climate change will be the reason for the next great war think about it all a country or group of nations has to do is convince their citizens that there s only so many resources to go around therefore as a nation we must do whatever it takes to protect our piece of the pie could a charismatic leader convince a nation that there is only room for so many people on this planet why not have our chosen nation be the shepherds of a new earth we deserve clean water fresh air stabilized climates our enemies waste resources with disregard for our nation s future generations therefore they must be terminated the notion that any of us could survive a total societal  is laughable and largely based on egotistical thinking odds are you will be swallowed up in a massive tidal wave or trampled by looters odds are you will die of thirst in a long slow unremarkable death could a charismatic leader mobilize a nation to take arms against those that threaten its survival look at the united states they have a fraction of the earth s population and use a quarter of its resources that s a large target for a leader to hone in on war is predicated on an us vs them mentality if climate change is a threat to all of humanity how easy would it be to convince a nation tribe that only so many can survive and in order for our tribe to survive all others must die
1,does anyone feel a strange sense of hope regarding the pandemic i go through periods of anxiety but i have this sense of optimism because i see that the veil is being lifted on the lies our government has fed us people are waking up and capitalism is falling apart this is the time to make changes and i honestly see this happening people in social distancing spending time with themselves to unpack capitalistic ideas and getting in touch with themselves people developing a greater appreciation of love and community the earth getting a break from harmful toxins not because of humans but because of capitalism and imperialism

1,what nation do you think will trigger the next world war if i put my personal politics aside i think north korea is the most credible threat this is one of the few issues where i strongly disagree with people in my own political echo chamber i believe the dprk in north korea has every intention to start a world war besides that i think a world war could happen due to the issues in israel and palestine and the behavior of saudi arabia as a whole i worry less about china because they prefer to sell the world rather than slaughter it hardly noble but arguably less concerning
1,people in collapsing societies become self destructive thus accelerating  i read chris hedges america the farewell tour and one idea he described there really stuck with me the idea was that people in collapsing societies throughout the history fall into anomie gt societies are held together by a web of social bonds that give individuals a sense of being part of a collective and engaged in a project larger than the self this collective expresses itself through rituals such as elections and democratic participation or an appeal to patriotism and shared national beliefs the bonds provide meaning a sense of purpose status and dignity they offer psychological protection from impending mortality and the meaninglessness that comes with being isolated and alone the shattering of these bonds plunges individuals into deep psychological distress that leads ultimately to acts of self annihilation durkheim called this state of hopelessness and despair anomie which he defined as ruleless ness in general people who have to live with terrible consequences of collapsing society feel that it s collapsing these people are not digging a bunker to prepare for some cataclysm but they feel this hopelessness or impending doom or anomie what s really interesting is that it drives population to self destruct that is people behave in such ways that destroys them or their society almost as if to fasten the birth death cycle of civilisations gt society durkheim wrote is no longer sufficiently present for individuals those cast aside can participate in the society as durkheim wrote only through sadness the self destructive pathologies that plague the united states opioid addiction morbid obesity gambling suicide sexual sadism hate groups and mass shootings rise out of this anomie hedges then gives many examples in his book of how us population has reached this point of terminal anomie you can read more here but i would really recommend reading his america the farewell tour

1,trump is winning now i am sad hey guys trump is winning again
1,some basic math on how increased transmission is much worse than increased death tl dr increased transmission can mean more deaths than a direct lethality increase because a more people infected means more die and b too many infected at a given time overwhelms hospitals and makes disease untreated let s do some math say a disease has a lethality rate and infects x as many people every days it also takes days for people to die so to add up the deaths just add of how many people got infected the previous day cycle base people infected day infected day people dead people infected day dead infected day dead lethality doubled to people infected day infected day dead infected day dead infected day dead transmission doubled to x every days people infected day people infected day dead people infected on day dead people infected day dead as you can see doubling transmission kills over x as much as base transmission and around more people than doubled lethality also keep in mind again that since hospitals can t treat all cases a transmission increase becomes a direct lethality increase as well say that the hospital in this scenario has a capacity of and those without treatment have a greater chance of dying or on base lethality and on doubled lethality with hospital capacity at base transmission and base death doesn t overshoot until day and at day you just have deaths of which are untreated deaths plus x plus x doubled death overshoots on day and has deaths on day plus x and x of which are untreated doubled transmission overshoots on day patients utterly overload the system of beds causing deaths on day from day x x infected on day leads to deaths by day x x compared to the on x lethality and from base all told the exponential nature of increased transmission and capacity overshoot means that a x increase in transmission leads to more than x as many deaths as base transmission and x as many as doubled lethality
1,covid will be there forever many of my friends tell me that if we re all vaccinated covid will eventually disapear i think it s not true whatever we do now it will be a seasonal disease as the flu hopefully vaccine could temper the number of deaths we ll face but let be honest we ll never get rid of it and we would have to take one jab or two every years and i m not sure people will accept it what do you think

1,the greatest story never told 
1,we are headed towards the great depression and it s not because of capitalism by definition free market capitalism is an economic system with minimum government interference under capitalism you can start a business and the rewards and failures are yours if your business fails and you go bankrupt it s your loss if you make it big it s your gains in the usa we operate in a system where the government takes most of your profits meddles in how you run your business and if you fail it can go two ways small businesses get a weak safety net but big businesses get bailed out and propped up using tax dollars and fake money if you are a hedge fund or major corporation you are basically operating in a system where you cannot fail if you even start to show weakness the fed will print money to keep you afloat this is the opposite of the fundamental definition of capitalism this policy has created an entire global economy built on debt which means one tiny disturbance can pop the debt bubble and cause a great depression capitalism is not the problem in fact it is the solution we need an economy where businesses fail where the government doesn t prop them up where our debt doesn t surge past our income that type of economy can withstand disturbances like a pandemic because it grows much slower and is based on actual production not phony debt fueled growth

1,what will be the last mammalian species to go extinct amp when we all know that many species are currently going extinct insects and bacteria probably will last longer than mammals certainly cockroaches can last a long time tardigrades are extremely tough they are categorized as extremophiles and can survive temperatures of near absolute zero and radiation levels in the millions of bequerels on the scale of survivability mammals are pretty weak in most respects but if you had to pick one mammal which would be the last one left standing in total mammalian extinction which one would it be mice nice and small pigs they ll eat just about anything ungulates cows horses etc they can eat and digest grass pretty good homo sap they can eat all the other mammals and each other too speculate in this thread on the last mammal left standing and when it will buy it s ticket to the great beyond re
1,how would we know today if the end was really happening there s more worldwide communication now than there s ever been most of the world has a computer in their pocket there s also a lot of gloom and doom conspiracy questionable news biases etc so how would we really know that it was going down would it take something worldwide disastrous like a planetary weather event or something slower like disease accidentally released and if it starts to go down how long before we lose our cell phone communications i know people from new orleans who swear that the government shut down the area code during katrina if you were here and had a cell with an area code from somewhere else your phone worked i know that to be true as mine did amp xb so some questions
1,i think that there is a risk of another pandemic happening by the end of this year into next year and people are ignoring this since june this year there are reports of other viruses with endemic properties there is also chance for sars cov mutating even further leading us into a possible double pandemic there are several factors for a dire future regarding infectious diseases this includes overpopulation cattle mismanagement with antibiotic overusage climate change and deforestation wildlands encroachment right now covid taught us a lesson which several people still ignore there are no boundaries for infectious diseases if we do not grow sustainably and if we are not united pandemics need energetic and bold response from both world and community leaders yet people are ignoring these warnings countries such as india usa russia mexico brazil failed to provide the right answers and their people are also polarized due to politics i am pretty sure the following years are going to be very dread in the sense that if us remains in the hands of diabolical greed people ignorance may reign if the world is struck by a another pandemic the poor the minorities the unaided suffer more the answer may even come with civil military conflicts not to mention the ongoing economic crisis bubble growing up repeating the last century story to the max
1,so you have more infected people than us now just saying you could have prevented a lot of this from happening by taking italy as an example of what to do and what not to do it makes me sad that a lot of you didn t even listen to us and just kept doing dumb stuff meanwhile people here are dying for the same reason they will die in the us just useless deaths that no one learnt anything from also stop being sad because you have to stay in quarantine we re living the same reality and i think you re overreacting an advice i can give is to stay close to each other spiritually and go buy things for that one lonely old neighbor don t act selfishly like some of you did until now it s just disgusting behavior anyways you ll learn all of this by yourself one way or another it s just a matter of time remember that you re the new italy now with probably less deaths than us but still so it s your turn to give the world some advice i hope they ll be listening to what you say good luck and stay safe

1,climate confusion what s reliable hey everyone recently i ve been trying to gain a better understanding of the climate crisis and so far i ve been extremely dismayed not only because the projections are so bad but because there is such a wide range of predictions for what might happen on the extreme doomer end we have people like guy mcpherson those predicting inevitable planetary  and human extinction and on the extreme optimist end we have people like michael mann who seem to think we are on a path to getting climate under control and that doomist attitudes are unhelpful and unsupported by the science between these two you have people like david wallace wells who seems to suggest we can expect around degrees of warming by the end of the century a catastrophic impact to be sure but certainly not life extinguishing wallace wells has been criticized by both mann and mcpherson for exaggerating and downplaying the risks respectively now personally i m somewhat in the middle leaning far more towards the doomer side of things but i feel the stress of not only confronting the possibly inevitable end of humanity but the confusion of sorting through the science to determine what s going on to begin with the climate and our global ecosystem are incredibly complex and there is much we do not understand about them on top of that i do not come from a scientific background and thus am not very well suited to assessing the information available thus when i see debates over the severity of climate change the anguish of dealing with the massive losses that are certainly guaranteed is complicated by the confusion over what to expect i admit i would certainly like to believe that we are not totally doomed but at the same time i can t rule out the possibility and if this is the case i would prefer to know the truth or perhaps i am deluding myself here and would in fact not prefer to know the truth either way it seems like there is not enough certainty to make a clear assessment aside from a vague understanding that we are fucked has anyone else experienced this confusion it is difficult for me to live in a world of half ghosts often believing that the end is inevitable yet without the confidence in my knowledge to simply give up hope even remaining engaged with the science is psychologically taxing but to avoid it makes me feel as though something is creeping up on me and i can only control my anxiety by confronting the facts i just wish i could talk to an expert but even then i would be unsure how much i could trust their perspective

1,i have seen the  and it is made up of queues living in new york the thing that has been most striking to me is the fact that in spite of the wild inconvenience aggravation and constant mild sense of panic everyone is lining up very courteously and waiting inordinate amounts of time for everything i think this is a very realistic situation should there be widespread shortages although humans are often wildly unpredictable it does seem that there is a general sense amongst everyone that they need to keep their shit together or it will become dangerous so everyone s keeping their shit together

1,doing things by hand when lack of supply makes our modern facilities stop working main problem is most people cannot stand arduous labour the ones over here i was thinking off are alternative communities who try to become self sufficient in food production problem is most of the members do not want to engage in farming but rather outside jobs household and repair instead getting enough hands to run their own farm is stressful also they cannot reach self sufficiency organic farmers over here completely work like conventional farmers except such things like the brand of pesticides and fertilizer plus giving the animals more space of letting them go outdoor compared to industrialized farming where things are done by hand is community gardening yet one main problem remains the arduous labour people run away quicker than they assemble i frankly admit me too

1,signs of the coming apocalypse and what to do reading many of the posts here i am feeling concerned for most of us but especially the young background i have been following global trends since the s and in the early days i focused on geopolitics as it was the height of the cold war i spent some time in the military to prepare for these days my biggest feel good moment was the fall of the berlin wall as now finally we can put our differences aside and work together on the big issues how wrong was i the trends to watch also from these observations three big trends i felt needed to be followed more closely population growth we ve all see the graphs of the exponential rise food and water these are one of the causes of famine and conflicts pollution of which air pollution and therefore climate change is just one effect you might think that there are many other trends we could be following but it will not be hard to trace the root of those trends to one of these three some related trends are resource depletion refugee migration co rise as examples but you can link these back to those three so what can we do and are doing scientists have developed six steps after giving warnings in and and many more before between and after and provide data to the un s ipcc the un have developed sustainable development goals but requires national and local governments to ratify and implement because the un has no authority over individual countries decision making processes politicians need to implement these sdgs with urgency and pass legislation and local laws and work with local scientists and the population to get them onboard individuals need to see the greater good as opposed to personal needs and support politicians and leaders and other ground roots groups making an effort on these sdgs now depending on your age if you are older like me your role is to help the younger generations as much as possible give them money leadership opportunities and your knowledge e g most of my wealth and effort is directed at that dont have children and dont get all ohhh and ahhh when your friends and family have them but if they do encourage the children as much as possible as i said above if you are young and just starting out you really need to focus on education and skills to make yourself more valuable and resourceful i e you need to have money leadership or knowledge to cope with the coming crises so what does the future looking like well in a nutshell bleak urban life will be like what has been depicted in blade runner films and rural life will be like depicted in mad max films there have been many other ideas of future dystopia but these seem the most likely but that does not mean you should give up doing stuff now if we try our best to get some of the un s sdgs implemented locally we may be able to save millions if not billions of people here is where you can learn more

1, vs inertia inertia can significantly retard  as promised tomorrow afternoon i will post the rebuttal on gail tverberg s recent post i politely asked ms tverberg to close her blog if  did not take place this year and incredibly my request made it she refused as i expected but that s ok anatoly karlin who posts in unz com wrote that current trends will continue and not much chance of a  and a bio singularity i e transhumanism will take over although i think natural resource shortages will present a huge challenge it can t be denied that in most cases all attempts of change are defeated by the status quo ante and things return back to what it used to be as if nothing ever happened few people remembered people like jan huss and john wycliffe until the papal powers were driven out from where they used to run around and the protestants decided to create new heroes from the dust few people remember peter waldo a th century reformer whose followers mostly existed in lyon in france or the piedmont mountains of what is now italy which never came under control of protestants they were mostly exterminated by the end of th century and the few survivors fled to other lands and mingled with whatever sects dominant in there such is how it ended until fossil fuels began to make a huge difference but now the age of ff is ending so we are simply going back to where it was before the ff era began circa human behavior and human inertia are amazing even during  order will be imposed by force the streelights of berlin were abundant of bodies hanged by the hitler jugend for cowardice in the last days of third reich history is cruel and surviving it is not easy and not something you want to tell your children hence very few fathers choose to tell their war stories to their children i think that during a  various attempts to establish order will take place some more successful than others which means complete  can be averted in some locales which hopefully will be sizable enough to rebuild some kind of viable sanctuary for civilization drivers to at least hang their hats for a while

1,why the world ends next year why you don t know we have one year to act action takes years to effect anything we do will be insufficient and ineffectual at best you don t not need to be smart insightful or deeply empathetic to know this this is basic knowledge you are not allowed to consider it s not a conspiracy you re just not allowed to know it because mars self driving cars and g pensions depend on it golden parachutes are more important for now next year is quaternary crazy tear where you ll be promised the world and all you really get is war if the proles and plebes don t unite before then we fucked current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required human induced climate change is an existential risk to human civilisation an adverse outcome that will either annihilate intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential unless carbon emissions are rapidly reduced special precautions that go well beyond conventional risk management practice are required if the increased likelihood of very large climate impacts known as fat tails are to be adequately dealt with the potential consequences of these lower probability but higher impact events would be devastating for human societies the bulk of climate research has tended to underplay these risks and exhibited a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach climate policymaking and the public narrative are significantly informed by the important work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc however ipcc reports also tend toward reticence and caution erring on the side of least drama and downplaying the more extreme and more damaging outcomes whilst this has been understandable historically given the pressure exerted upon the ipcc by political and vested interests it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally what were lower probability higher impact events are now becoming more likely this is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system such as the polar ice sheets and hence sea levels and permafrost and other carbon stores where the impacts of global warming are non linear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge however the extreme risks to humanity which the tipping points represent justify strong precautionary management under reporting on these issues is irresponsible contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of and response to climate change if climate policymaking is to be soundly based a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk management framework is now urgently required this must be taken up not just in the work of the ipcc but also in the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc negotiations if we are to address the real climate challenge current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required gt most populations accept the most flagrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them and were never

1,help us please call for international solidarity do you have a platform that reach many people are you down with supporting self organized indigenous action protecting forests animals and culture then read below and help this campaign get an outreach we are a group of indigenous people who on our own carry out inspections and protect our territories on you can find more info about guardioes da floresta and their struggle to protect their land and the biodiversity in contrast to the bolsonaro administrations laws and acting with the current pandemic many of the financial issues have become complicated and this is reflected in our actions as we need money to do a good part we created this campaign in order to raise funds so that we can carry out our inspections in the territory against loggers and illegal miners so that we can buy equipment for our actions such as clothes tools electronic equipment etc also to help in our legal front with lawyers seeking the minimum that is our right through legal channels but we are not stuck only in these ways as it should be the state s duty to inspect and punish environmental crimes but they do nothing else if not to be enticed with this crime by facilitating large farmers at the expense of the degradation of our fauna flora and the extinction policy of indigenous peoples along with their culture
1,mass draft dodging i see people here talking about the likelihood of ww happening if there was a draft we would see the highest amount of people draft dodging ever most people think these wars are bullshit even republicans realize the iraq war was a scam more people would conscientiously object and many people would probably would take a jail cell over being shot at in the middle of nowhere any day we ve all seen the vietnam stories there would be massive protests if they started drafting as well nobody cares about honor or any of that bullshit anymore not to mention more people then ever wouldn t qualify due to mental illness how would the state respond if all the able bodied men start rejecting draft
1,the division of labor was probably a mistake take this for what you will but i have just been thinking about this recently you ever notice how on the news or tv whenever they bring up something you happen to have a large knowledge base on let s say guns or computers etc they tend to be just blind deaf and dumb or even in day to day conversation i believe this is because we live in a social structure that forces and even somewhat encourages us to be complete idiots with of what s going on in the world except for the one or two specific things that they aren t idiots on ie occupation or hobby more complicated of a world you live in the more of an opportunity you have to be a damaging idiot on a larger scale i think this is why people have so much trouble accepting climate change and even among those who don t directly deny it you still get kind of metaphysical denials like our renewable tech will mature in time the way we have forecast no one else will change why should i give up my luxury i believe our technology will be our savior let s sequester some carbon and block the sun etc like people don t realize or don t want to come to terms with being forced to become more poor and humble because we ve wrongly attributed to ourselves what we should ve attributed to the resources and energy we recklessly siphoned off of our only home and it s not like people are so stupid or anything saying such things is nothing more than a petty statement of oh i m totally the smarter one it s that these people have not been given an adequate opportunity to digest all of the most important information and as we bloat our world with unnecessary complication it can only get worse not to mention it also makes the economy and social structure ridiculously ableist i believe this also ties into how helpless a good chunk of the population has become to a situation without the structure we have built up and it s not really their fault it s the fault of the ridiculous social system which allowed such a thing to happen on this planet in the first place i m not even sure how people could transition to a much more generalized perspective and way of life all i know is the physical systems we have stressed beyond belief will probably force our hand at some point if that happens it won t be pretty
1,in light of impending doom how i m staying hopeful i ve been stuck in my current location for the last few years dealing with some medical issues i ve used that time to do a lot of research and thinking about where in the world i want to settle down i want a home base where i can work on strategies for mitigating the human driven ecological  currently underway i ve been spending most of my free time in libraries studying ecology mycology mushrooms permaculture and the use of insects as food my medical issues are close to being resolved and i m excitedly planning my migration to minnesota by the end of i ll be going to minneapolis initially but within three of four years i hope to move further north i ve been looking at real estate listings near some of the small towns on the north coast of anishinaabewi gichigami lake superior the forests begin on the north coast of the lake and extend well up into canada that region has some of the most intact biodiversity anywhere in north america anishinaabewi gichigami is one of the largest bodies of fresh water in the world i imagine that will prove invaluable in helping the surrounding regions weather the climactic changes as they worsen i am not anti technology i do believe strongly that we should strive to only use technology that works in harmony with nature i believe that humans are incredibly resourceful and that it is possible for us to find ecologically sound technological systems that can provide for our needs in terms of water and food and shelter even through unpredictable climatic changes and ecological s mushrooms and insects can be valuable sources of food and medicine in the west especially we are nowhere near using them to their full potential i want to spend my time learning the forests intimately and fighting tooth and nail to preserve the bio diversity that still exists i want to find community with people who share similar goals i want to work for all i m worth to help that community become self sufficient and as independent as possible from the global economy my hope is that once such a community exists it could contribute toward building a larger social movement ideally people could be building similar communities around the world by creating decentralized communication networks these communities could share valuable information and help each other improve such a movement could eventually become a powerful force for change in this world i know full well that what i m about to attempt could fail spectacularly i am ok with that i don t have much to lose and i think it s worth trying i would love to hear your thoughts and criticisms anyone making similar plans any minnesota residents want to meet up and talk about this when i move later this year where else in the world could be viable locations for this kind of project

1,my  in i discovered a untouched secret in the way i was connected to an environmental way of life when i came home from college for christmas break my hometown had completely changed in and a half months my hometown had lost acres of wild space to make room for starbucks kohl s and dicks sporting goods our town was excited of the new shopping adventures as i was of understanding the complex web of our ecosystem i forgave the big business additions to my town thinking maybe it was only here truth is this was happening in towns what a great christmas it was for millions of ppl that they can go get a mocha fucking latte something and buy there whole family presents at kohl s and dicks i realized that i shouldn t hate them they are only human they will burn enough fossil fuels to kill them but it s not their fault its moths into the flame it s the ultimate intelligence of the species that wasnt quite enough for long term survival humans were quite smart but not smart enough to know how they were limiting their existence its fate and you shouldn t bear any guilt for it i ve discovered this paradox in thinking had i been born from the baby boomer womb how could i not have enjoyed building the new empire it must have felt great thinking you are working hard to make a better life for your kids grandkids now we want to blame them for ruining the future when all they tried for was living in comfort i know our time is coming to an end but i cant help thinking how in the end of that th hour when artic circle melts we discover a new species of man that had contributed to the last big warming event and several weeks into this discovery our species goes extinct

1,can we have another r  vs r  debate 
1,is a catastrophe the solution through another post i was able to read this interesting article i was delighted by this article because maybe a total  wouldn t be as bad because society could restart again yes i remember that this time is not only a financial  but the environmental issues however reading the last paragraph gave me an idea what if another catastrophic epidemic wipes out at least of earth s population this would be a great shock however it d be beneficial less people eating food and drinking water less workers available so wages could start to improve etc now if aids and ebola have not been very effective to reduce population what could be it i hope nature helps us but i don t see it possible
1,best areas to be in the future climate of the us genuine question what areas of the united states are going to be the most hospitable in the next few years i know really every where is going to change but i m in the pnw and want to get out before my town burns to a crisp or i choke to death on the air and idk watching the area i grew up in completely change seems more unsettling then somewhere i don t remember the before period planning on moving in a year and want to start looking at places to go

1,the time of sorrow i look at this page ofter which is useful for reducing any form of motivation and positive outlook to zilch i m significantly despondent in my life i don t have hope and struggle keeping a daily routine of life and work i do my best to keep at ease and healthy in mind and body all that my life is founded on all that our lives are founded on is a dangerously insane story of progress and growth without limits and fuck load of greenhouse gas emissions that is going to cause the end of civilisation as we know it i want so much to believe in a new story that the remaining hopefuls are canvassing in desperate abandon extinction rebellion the kids climate march etc but i don t believe it s going to make an iota of difference the powers that be continue to wreak havoc over everything that our lives rely on fossil fuel corporations knew full well the extent of the damage they would cause as they were causing it same with governments same with the public really at the moment there is a doubling down burn more coal find more oil in more precarious locations before public sentiment really does shift i don t believe in our ability to change the story and replace it with one of hope and strength and purpose we need an enormous amount of global collaboration and a shift in lifestyle that even the most hopeful do not want to give up tech flying etc we need this crazy amount of change in order to have a shit time degrees warming compared to a completely apocalyptic one our politics needs to transform our economy needs to transform our lifestyles need to transform our belief that we are superior over everything needs to flip completely upside down in the next three years really well really years ago years ago that s not going to happen what s going to happen in the next five years when those with a little hope loose it when carbon emissions only rise and all the feedback loops turn out to be times worse or fast than anticipated i think it s depressing now what happens next soon to our culture our story how do you live knowing there is only waaaay more gloom to come what are some tips to maintain some sanity do you do activism does it help or feel futile how do you keep living well in a dying world are you prepping and planning to be more resilient i feel like i know some of answers keep busy with what good i can contribute express love and meditate on being in the present moment feel gratitude for everything that is here and lovely rather than what is lost and what we are loosing go camping don t rush take psychedelics call your parents and loved ones more often i feel like not looking at this thread would help because it s fucked it s gloom and doom porn it s a hard pill to swallow but it s more true than what s on netflix or in most papers do people regulate how much they look at climate change and  related stuff or is it better to lean into it and cultivate panic into something that can guide you to somewhere more resilient is that a thing i recently read the uninhabitable earth by david wallace wells great book sad truths he writes something like we are always the authors of the future we can always make the future less fucked than it s current course i want to move from my despairing franticness to a calmer place that takes it all on board and acts but everything is hard i watch a interview with david suzuki last night and he was mad and desperate as well clinging to the supposed chance of keeping global warming below degrees i love and am inspired by that clinging to hope but i can t find it in myself to hold onto and then just feel lost in the void thanks if you read this far in my ramble i have no idea what we can do with the feeling of complete loss

1,nuclear war rest assured there will not be a nuclear war any time soon the us and russia learned a lot from the cold war they know what they can and cannot do to understand why this will not escalate into a nuclear war i first must explain the reason the us would dare attack a russian ally and risk nuclear holocaust i must explain the syrian conflict in order for you to understand why a  will not occur from a nuclear war assad wants to kill rebels quickly the longer it takes the more dug in the rebels will be indiscriminate bombing is the fastest way to kill rebels the civilians will become rebels because they feel alienated by the indiscriminate bombing civilians and rebels are both targets for assad assad bombs hospitals to keep supplies out of the hands of rebels chemical weapons are more efficient and cost effective than conventional ordinance assad was testing to see how the new administration would react to chemical weapons trump fires tomahawk cruise missiles in a public relations gimmick corporations get a contract for new missiles you see the us strike was just a public relations gimmick the russians know this and will not fire nuclear weapons this is a  related post because i talked about the possibility of a nuclear war
1,why syria will never recover from the civil war it s estimated that the economy has been slashed by more than between and in and the decline in gdp continued with declines of and respectively it s expected that the decline in gdp will continue every year until so let s assume that by syria is ready to start recovering how long will it take decades in it was estimated that if the conflict ceased immediately followed by a annual gdp growth rate the country would take thirty years to recover in other words by syria would be back to where it was in but how realistic is that not very realistic the syrian government s budget depended on oil revenues those revenues won t come back the oil fields have been exhausted when germany was blown to bits in it could recover relatively quickly because it had access to bountiful coal deposits american foreign aid and a stable functional government the population of the country was relatively homogeneous with no real feuds and other lingering conflicts that would continue after the world war syria has no real chance of inheriting such a situation civil wars are inherently different from regular wars between nation states they pit people against each other and create a culture that s skeptical of authority and long term investments in syria rag tag militias are now in control of large parts of the country forcing jizya taxes on religious minorities and reaping tolls off truck drivers transporting goods such groups now earn a nice source of income and have a motive to keep the conflict going religious minorities who fled cities that were bombarded can not return as their return would simply mean more tinder being added to the fire it s noteworthy that much of yugoslavia so far still hasn t recovered to the economic situation of the s of course the underlying causes of the syrian civil war aren t going away they re about to get much worse the drought in syria that preceded the civil war was the worst drought in years problems like these are merely going to get worse in the years ahead climatic stability is necessary to have political stability even an increase in fertility of the land can destabilize a region as an increase in fertility of the land allowed the mongols to build their massive empire another factor that underlies the civil war is demographic pressure syria is ruled by alawites who receive support from christians druze and other shia sects these groups fear the consequences of rule by the sunni majority in the non sunni population of the country had declined to down from in this is simply due to the sunni having higher fertility rates than the religious minorities if the minorities manage to preserve their minority coalition which looks likely thanks to russian support then we could expect the conflict will merely reemerge decades in the future syria is a case study of  it s among the first nations to  as a result of the dominant problems we currently face demographic changes climate change and resource depletion it shows that the way down can be much faster than the way up other nations appear likely to follow in syria s footsteps
1,rise of the animal kingdom recent articles have caught my attention in regard to animals showing up in groups at times very aggressively interacting with humans what are the chances that we will see this type of activity increase could this be their way of taking back what s left are they finally showing their outrage over the consequences of pollution this may sound absurd and very kipling hence it is anything is possible roaming raccoons one of several orca articles what are your thoughts

1,people miss the biggest reason we likely won t be able to stop climate change i m a undergrad biology major in the u s so i m not the most experienced person in the world when it comes to all the ecological drivers of climate change but i get the sense that people miss the forest for the trees in regards to ideas for stopping climate change people like to point to specific ideas and items and actions that can be changed to stop climate change like getting rid of plastic straws or stopping deforestation of the rainforests or recycling or taxing carbon emissions however in doing this people ignore the single biggest driver of climate change supply chains and transportation in the modern day and age we ship vast quantities of every good imaginable across the world selling it for low costs in supermarkets the world over i can go to the store and buy fruits vegetables meats and huge varieties of processed foods a huge amount of this food is wasted and disposed of but that s beside the point the point is it takes energy to get that apple in your pantry from farm to food to table primarily that energy to fuel shipping comes from oil which releases pollution into the atmosphere use electric powered vehicles people cry sure use electricity but that doesn t change the net energy cost to transfer your apple you ve just shifted the cost to the power grid instead which runs off of primarily fossil fuels multiply that energy cost for a single apple millions of times over and you get a tremendous number farm to store to table is only one example of a supply chain i work in a hospital occasionally in materials management i help make sure nurses and hospital floors are stocked with medical supplies and sundry a huge variety of products the majority of which are made of non biodegradable plastics are produced in a factory shipped and delivered all incurring large net energy costs the list of different chains could go on if you live in a western country you probably drive or own a car at some point in your life burning yet more fuel the productions costs of scientific tools the costs of research travelling to different countries all efforts to stop climate change depend on these massive energy intensive supply chains indeed modern life in the first world countries could not exist without the incredible ability to ship goods quickly and cheaply to the average consumer modern life depends on energy intensive supply chains efforts to stop climate change depend on supply chains and that modern lifestyle given that modern educational standards quality of life etc must be maintained to fight understand climate change but depend entirely on modern supply chains it follows that climate change will not be beaten or stopped the chief weapon against climate change i e an educated liesurely populace that can produce and support the necessary number of experts in the field of science rather than practical fields like farming or the trades can only be sustained by huge energy cost ironically climate change would not be an issue at all if supply chains were not so large or at least not in a near time span if population was reduced to about a billion modern supply chains could be sustainably maintained tl dr wrote this on my phone supply chains are fucked transportation is fucked just keep on doing your thing til it all s or adapts
1,where are all the movies and tv shows about climate change why do they seem to just not exist you d think that there would be an explosion of literature and arts exploring the very real threat to all our civilizations looking at potential scenarios and how they might play out etc etc you d think it d be the number one topic instead of zombie apocalypse movies and marvel remakes but no there hasn t been an explosion not even a noticeable uptick of fictional media exploring these themes in depth it s not like we can t psychologically handle existential threats when nuclear war was the major threat to the world look how many movies and shows were made about it so clearly there is effort being made to discourage specific themes in popular art no doubt there are plenty of ideas and pitches out there but when it comes to actual funding there are relatively few major players controlling the purse strings the point of this post is not to get too deep into the how and the why instead i d really just like to clarify exactly what we have so far so i d love to know which movies and tv shows you guys would recommend as actually showing at least half correct science with an unambiguous climate change related message i literally cannot come up with anything that truly fits the criteria there s stuff like beasts of the southern wild and snowpiercer and a handful of others but neither of those examples are scientifically accurate or trying to be or unambiguous in their message then there s stuff like and the day after tomorrow and i think we all know they re utter crap in terms of science so hit me up with your suggestions please i m seriously in need of some fictional inspirational material that will help to guide me through this darkness thank you
1,which future to invest in i recently gave birth to a beautiful baby boy he s as sweet as can be and has truly changed me as a person on so many levels here s the thing i didn t want to have kids not because i don t love kids but because i can t promise them any type of security in this world i know ultimately no parent can but i mean we really truly can t at this point in history if it were just me i wouldn t care in the way that i do i ll fight for what s right until my last breath but i don t fear my own death i fear for him what kind of world will he grow in what kind of world will he die in how soon will his life be cut short due to the downfall of man what can i do for him to give him as much as i can for the future my partner and i are planning ks life insurance trust funds anything and everything we can to give him something but all of that something is just part of a doomed system without that system it s just wasted time and money are these investments worth our time or should we be funneling our energy into something different for him

1,about those academic estimates which claim we will face the consequences of our natural destruction in a very distant year like or we all know those academic researches which claim humanity will suffer from it s destructive actions after one century or more they always use those distant dates to make people uninterested after all they won t experience it or humanity will find a way out if it is in distant future so why care about it the unfortunate fact is we are facing ecological disasters today ecological systems are collapsing right at this moment only thing those bourgeois scientists are doing is fooling people to think we are not in danger we are in danger now the highly arrogant bourgeois academicians are asserting this society based on infinite growth can continue forever it won t their expired capitalist ideology leaks drop by drop from their works emissions are growing even more rapidly than the economy even though all the technological advancements none of the global deals made a change in the general course of emission growth energy producers do not let the transition to clean energies because it would mean end of the business for them they talk about electrical vehicles today do you know what first cars were electrical it is just that american oil companies didn t like this situation a lot capitalism has become a obstacle for the healthy development of humanity greed of the few north american and west european tycoons are pushing our world towards a disaster humanity had never experienced prior to this recently i made a post about the drought in turkey guess what happened there have been heavy thunderstorms after the long drought and now all the major cities are flooding here things like these will become more and more common climate crisis will start to the end of this decade not this century this decade
1,homogenous societes like the uk in ww amp mostlyl pulled together i need research on multicultural societies the uk imports around of its food with a population of around million i d expect mass starvation as soon as shit goes south at least major disruptions in various kinds of food this got me wondering about the changing demographics of the uk mostly centred in london the melting pot of london already has factions there s muslim neighbourhoods and somalian enclaves and several other ethnic centres the same gun and gang cultures of america are seen in london right now everyone gets on quite well many businesses are a nice mix of ethnicities residential areas are fairly ethnically diverse with some large exceptions like tower hamlets and others the gangs operate in their own areas but when shit goes south i d hope everyone there can pull together like in ww and but how often do multicultural communities do that i don t know it s tricky to google hence my post here if anyone has some good examples i d be happy to see them what i expect would happen is people pull back to their own communities and resource fights occur along ethnic lines why would i say that well i guess there s been low level racism between all the groups in the past somalis pakistanis indian jamaican english little things that mean nothing day to day but things that color interactions and then are remembered in times of difficulty one example that stands out for me in times of disaster are that muslim men are taught to see all muslim men everywhere as brothers so there s a motivational factor to put muslim men first over other people i hope i m wrong but what i expect to happen in big cities liverpool birmingham london etc are people of every ethnicity will dig in and try and put their neighbours and themselves first this insulation will increase as food supplies and society get more strained i m not aware of any plans the government has to prevent this breakdown of social structure and once it happens and society gets fractured pulling together will almost be impossible fractured groups who used to get on together will then be fighting each other for meagre supplies the government s made interesting and varied huge cities that s cool but as far as i know they have no plans for when shit goes south apart from the likely anti riot vans and police cities in a long standing emergency will be bad places to be for anyone

1,because the world is so dystopian are responsible parents priced out of having children i will never have any children but if i do then i would want to be a responsible parents and save up money first before having children for example if i predict my baby will cost me million i will save up that money first i won t rely on a good job or a roof over my head tied to a mortgage to get by to be a responsible parents you cannot expose your child to any financial uncertainties however because if a dystopian future eg housing affordability is a huge problem if you don t save up around k for your child to buy them eg an apartment outright you are pretty much consigning your child to a lifetime of wage slavery imagine your child doing deliveroo riding in their youth just to pay the rent your daughter might become a prostitute or sugar baby just to pay the rent or to save up to afford the deposit on a k apartment or million house a responsible parent would buy an apartment or house for their children then there is climate change with climate change there is a lot of uncertainty eg there will be resource scarcity potential riots water levels rising etc all this will add security costs it will cost to protect your child adding the direct cost of children k to the cost of having housing unaffordability k to the cost of climate change k and you have about million you need in wealth set aside for your child before you have them if housing unaffordability and climate change gets worse then for responsible parents they are effectively priced out of children it is irresponsible to have children given the dystopian future we face

1,basically there are only two choices dies and the remaining reach a higher level of civilization and to the stars or everyone dies in a dark age tl dr either of the world s best survive and take civilization to the next level or everyone falls down into dark age and slow death i am sorry to say but that is how things are going now resource depletion will hit sooner or later no need to argue when it will occur but it will be in the lifetime of most people now alive that plus a host of problems all discussed to death at here will take place within a half century the only question now is how it will end either the of the world s best and brightest leave the rest behind and advance to a newer level of civilization or the rest are successful destroying the realm of the killing most of the world s best and brightest in the process and choose a slooooow death in a dark age which would be below what artorius a roman commander turned an english ruler had after roman rule d in england on th century artorius ended up like that and as we all know he ultimately failed because the people did not care about roman civilization since they were kept out of it due to barriers set by romans themselves and didn t give two cents for the  of something they did not relate to no happy endings are possible because of the short lifespan of various storage methods anything not written down in paper and ink will fade within years any preparation or so will be irrelevant after years or so when the preppers many of them happen to be childless like the nearings slowly exit the world the survivors would not likely be in a mood to learn the old skills like the people of th th centuries were not in a mood to learn any useful skills unlike these days there are no more undeveloped lands most of the few indigenous people still clinging on life using old way of doing things wouldn t survive the first few months of  from the mass of hungry desperate survivors who won t think beyond their next meal so either the dieoff occurs in an orderly and systematic way or it occurs in the natural way the first case civilization has a chance to advance further to a new height the second case all is lost a hard but necessary question which will be answered in the next half century one way or another the georgia guidestones were actually much kinder than what i predict since whoever erected it intended to save of the world pop now about times more than how it will unfold

1,dear r  i need your advice on what moves to make help a worried college student out this may not be the best subreddit to post in but i figured i could start here i am currently an undergraduate college student who is beginning to see what you all have probably been seeing for a while now modern man is crumbling i understand or am attempting to comprehend the magnitude of what is happening and where our country and our world are headed my worry is that i might be starting too late perhaps i am just being spooked but after watching this video which was posted recently the soonest things could really take a turn for the worst is july regardless of how soon things are predicted to happen yes i know the fall is happening right now i d like to ask you all if you could direct me in some good places to start learning how to ride out these events i am not able or i cannot will myself at this moment to do the drop everything and move to the hills approach for i do have people i care about around me that i cannot afford to just leave behind i am talking about skills that i could learn and or other practices i can begin to take up if anyone has any literature that they could recommend this would also be very much appreciated i figure that picking up books from the library and reading up as fast as i can would be a good thing to do but again getting a starting point would be very helpful i apologize if i sound silly for asking all of this but i am going through a very rough awakening to all of these events over the past few months i am trying to keep up with world events and news and am making many of the conclusions that indeed we are on a sinking ship i seem to be one of the only college student really looking at the world and thinking serious thoughts other than shit s real fucked in the world or even worse the it s college news doesn t get through to us on campus people thanks for all of your help and good luck to you all in the future

1,economists in command of modern societies cannot envisage a system that would deliberately grow at a minimum rate even less so one that would experience zero growth and the idea of a carefully managed decline appears to them to be outright unimaginable gt what is the actual link between material consumption and objective and subjective quality of life once the basic needs for food clothes shelter and mobility are well satisfied going from material misery to modest material comfort will make many things in life better but obviously the link is not an endless escalator but if so where is the saturation point can such a level actually be quantified in a meaningful way these questions must be asked even if there are no easy answers mainly because of the situation that is the very opposite of the material poverty outlined at the beginning of this section too many people live in the condition of material excess and this does not endow them with a higher physical quality of life than that enjoyed by moderate consumers and it does not make them exceptionally happy at the most fundamental level the question is about the very nature of modern economies all but a tiny minority of economists those of ecological persuasion see the constant expansion of output as the fundamental goal and not just any expansion economies should preferably grow at annual rates in excess of better yet this is the only model the only paradigm and the only precept as the economists in command of modern societies cannot envisage a system that would deliberately grow at a minimum rate even less so one that would experience zero growth and the idea of a carefully managed decline appears to them to be outright unimaginable the pursuit of endless growth is obviously an unsustainable strategy and the post experience has shown how dysfunctional modern economies become as soon as the growth becomes negligible ceases temporarily or when there is even a slight decline rising unemployment falling labor participation growing income inequality and soaring budget deficits vaclav smil
1,i now look back on my years of climate activism as a colossal failure activists and scientists are now saying aloud what we all know we re fucked in this age of rapidly melting glaciers terrifying megafires and ever more puissant hurricanes of acidifying and rising oceans it is hard to believe that any further prod to climate action is needed but the reality is that we continue to live in a business as usual world our media is filled with enthusiastic announcements about new fossil fuel projects or the unveiling of the latest fossil fuelled supercar as if there s no relationship between such things and climate change yep no climate report or warning no political agreement nor technological innovation has altered the ever upward trajectory of the pollution this simple fact forces me to look back on my years of climate activism as a colossal failure the sad truth climate change is a problem of human psychology we have brains that are completely unfit for purpose to act on this crisis in fact if you could design a brain to be the least unsuited to dealing with climate change it would be the human brain there s no fix for that and even if there was it needed to happen like yesterday seems like a heap of climate activists and scientists are finally saying aloud what we all know we re fucked just wait until the masses realise
1,is don t have kids actually an answer i see the question what do i do pop up here all the time and the most common response is don t have kids it feels like one of those things that is simply known and never questioned the argument being that humans cost resources and therefore to have a child you are tying up x amount of future resources thereby impoverishing those who are already alive and guaranteeing that child has less than you did is that the thinking we are all on this  subreddit reading about the end of the world arguably we are the ones willing to accept if not deal with reality while most of the world continues on its merry way killing things and converting it to money that is the way of the world regardless of scale we are just doing things on an insane scale at an impossibly fast rate is not having kids really an answer my criticism is this if ignorance got us here in the first place how is objectively avoiding contributing to the future any kind of sane way to react i am not saying my some day child is going to be the next savior of a dying humanity but what i am suggesting is that i cannot know whether any lessons i have instilled in this child will have a positive lasting impact on the planet or maybe he is the lynchpin that undoes humanity s efforts to save itself who knows the answer is no one just seems to me that  readers who by definition are doing some level of self work even if it s just how do i stay sane today knowing what i know are the best to instill morals and ethics to the future if a parent who can see the world and understand how it works can share that with a child who can take that knowledge somewhere new wouldn t we be shooting ourselves in the foot making sure only ignorant fools who don t believe in  end up having children i guess the last big question then is does having a caring concerned parent who also cares for the earth the best way to get a generation of people who give a shit or do we get this shift by taking ourselves out of the great race and watching what other people s kids end up doing

1,how can there be no inflation jerome powell chair of the federal reserves says there is no inflation right now and there wont be any in the future i don t understand how they are calculating inflation at the federal reserve but housing prices have absolutely exploded my dad is a real estate agent and people are bidding houses up by k every week on just one street alone it s gone crazy people are buying houses without even viewing them any more i m starting to see shortages on stuff ranging from computer parts to jet skis i called all the jet ski dealers in my city and they ve been sold out since last september and the factory is canceling orders because they are running out of parts same goes for computer parts all the computer stores are out of gpus for gaming computers these are just two examples but i m sure there are other stuff with shortages that i m not aware of

1,by the year the entire population of the earth will start to complain of stuffy unpleasant air both indoors and outdoors and days with unpleasant smells stagnant air ground level ozone will increase no matter where you live hi all this will be a rather depressing read but be brave and read on every day i try to explain to people i meet that the earth s atmosphere is a closed system atmospheric c levels above ppm are dangerous but still will not kill you outright so we have to years left however when we reach ppm conditions indoors and outdoots will become extremely unpleasant even with windows open indoor levels will be permanently elevated around ppm shooting up to ppm in metro stations and shopping malls such high levels of atmpospheric c will start to displace oxygen in human brains leading to reduced mental capacity dementia even in young people dizziness depression fatigue impaired renal function increased cancer risk asthma high blood pressue and drowsiness some people will simply faint in crowded metro trains or indoor situations with many people and little ventilation children the elderly and people will asthma and other lung diseases will become chronically unwell from high c levels high c combined with heat and high humidity will feel extremely unpleasant and over several days or weeks will lead to increased mortality in affected populations when most of us think and hear about global warming we immediately imagine hot weather while in fact earh will turn into a gas chamber a moist greenhouse with no escape and one by one we will all asphyxiate from high c levels without human activity current atmospheric c would have been ppm perfect conditions for animals and vegetation to thrive for millions of years instead projections show we may reach ppm by the year such high level of c is incompatible with human life
1,psychology what keeps you going when you realize the situation hi r  it s been nearly a year now that i have started digging into the  topic it has brought lot s of feelings and questioning to my life especially in projecting myself into the future as of today i believe i passed the mourning stage and now starting to find a positive and viable plan for my our future i am a french citizen living in thailand working as a project developer for a german renewable energy company in apac i ve been doing this job for a decade now thinking it would change the world and be part of the solution to the problems we are facing in regards to our addiction to fossil fuels after getting more knowledge on the situation i realized that renewable energy will never replace fossil fuels which hindered my motivation to spend hours on a daily basis at the office for something that will have nearly no impact on the footprint we have on our planet i started to consider quitting my job and going back to france to get trained on organic farming before investing into a small plot of land to grow food and be part of a local network of resilient stakeholders this would mean a big reduction in my standard of living get out of my comfort zone and a risk to loose everything after investing all my savings in some land since then i started to ask myself the following questions how would countries like thailand will deal and accept expats once a global recession has kicked in oil and its derivative will start to be more and more expensive food energy security will be challenged would france be a better place to live the  would it be felt at a later stage then developing countries although a lot of transition communities exist in france the population concentration climate immigration and nuclear power plants are a big risk to consider how are you managing your savings as keeping money on a bank account seems risky would buying gold or investing in land be a good bet any other ideas how does did the idea of  influence your actual life setup and changed your plan for the future has anyone quit their office job to do something more helpful meaningful if yes what did you decide to do accordingly thank you for your time reading my thread i m surrounded by deniers or people claiming that technology will save us however i have my serious doubts hoping getting constructive feed backs here which could also help others

1,when will the upcoming crash happen most elite player s in the game try to avoid all that will start this next global economic crisis how long can they delay it just by the bau the next global economic crisis is around the corner reason is that there is a lack of available new exploration sites for unconventional fossil fuel since decades the ones been found are not being tapped anymore for the costs for that got too high so by is expected simply by demand extending supply that naturally price will rise but as our economy cannot cope with accelerating cost the next crash is then compulsory i mean we got now since some month a rise of oil price but still far below of the last global economic crisis level of dollar most player s in the game try to avoid all that will start this next global economic crisis how long can they delay it ideas

1,why aren t we living in an age of abundance every technological advancement since we figured out how to make a sharp rock should improve our situation it should allow us to meet our survival needs easier and give us more free time as well why doesn t this happen there are three possibilities population just gets larger environmental degradation ie the environment becomes less productive and requires more work for diminishing returns wealth accrues near the top and the masses never see the surplus what do you all think are the main factors driving this today if i was an outsider looking in at our species i would be so frustrated with the advancements we ve made and things we ve discovered we should hardly have to work at all we should have an incredible abundance and pristine ecosystems at the same time instead we work harder than our stone age ancestors have totally destroyed our environment and built our whole civilization on a finite resource that will diminish faster than we can adapt

1,the national aeronautics and space administration and the conflict of wallops island by contrast the national aeronautics and space administration nasa improbably seems to be incapable of responding to the very data it was tasked to gather on the rising sea levels around the globe this is described in fascinating detail in an installment in the reuters series on sea level rise wallops island virginia is part of the beautiful winding chain of barrier islands on the eastern seaboard of the united states a series of open bays and salt marsh the southern extension of chincoteague bay separates wallops island from the mainland nasa s billion dollar test flight facility is located on the southern end of the island and is used by a number of agencies including the navy noaa and commercial enterprises more than rockets have been fired from wallops island since world war ii a number of satellites with the specific mission of documenting the global sea level rise and the melting of the world s ice sheets have also been launched from here nearby planes from the international arctic research center record the pace of melting of the world s ice sheets the shoreline at wallops island has undergone at least years of documented chronic erosion the first seawall was constructed in the s and after storms has been extended augmented and repaired numerous times over the years by the early s about wooden groins had been built assawoman inlet a small inlet at the southern tip of the island closed sometime in the late s and no longer exists in the s nasa built the current foot high rock seawall in january a federal interagency assessment of the mid atlantic coast found that wallops island along with assawoman metompkin and cedar islands likely had crossed a geomorphic threshold from a relatively stable state into a highly unstable condition one in which rising seas could trigger significant and irreversible changes in geologic terms the islands are beginning to migrate and will likely shrink in size and be broken up by inlets in human terms this island is in trouble ten months after the report with its blunt and startling conclusions construction started on a million rocket assembly building and a million launch pad located a mere feet from the pounding surf on the southern end of the island the building phase was completed in two months before sandy roared by in recent years wallops island has been losing an average of feet of shoreline a year in early nasa proposed a million project to extend the seawall by about feet and to build a new mile long replenished sand beach characterized as a fifty year design life storm damage reduction project an expected longevity that is far off the scale of reality in an age of sea level rise the seawall and beach replenishment projects were approved and work was finally finished in august sandy damaged the new wall and washed away one quarter of the million cubic yards of new beach sand an million beach replenishment project to replace the sand lost in the hurricane paid out of the sandy relief fund began in july as required by law nasa had released a draft environmental impact statement eis on the plan the justification for the project was to reduce the need for the emergency repairs and the potential for storm induced physical damage to the more than billion in federal and state assets on wallops island the eis reviewers criticized the project design s inadequate consideration of rising sea levels and assessment of their impacts despite the passage recognizing the geomorphic threshold nasa responded by nearly doubling in the impact statement the number of references to the effects of sea level rise but in the official summary record of the decision which announced that wallops would proceed with the project sea level rise isn t mentioned anywhere the head scratching explanation according to the reuters articles on sea level rise is that nasa explained that it had whittled the issues down to only the highest points and sea level rise wasn t among them as part of the same project a foot long groin was proposed for the south tip of the island that would trap sand and widen the beach the proposal was similar to the spite groins of the jersey coast where several towns placed their longest groins at the south or downdrift end of town to capture as much sand as possible before it could reach the next town downstream a loud outcry from the environmental community and a complaint from the nature conservancy halted this wallops island groin project as the groin was certain to further erode the conservancy s island virginia coast reserve to the south in addition nasa is considering adding another launch pad enforcing its attitude toward sea level rise that is reflected by its decision making on wallops island such a decision by this the very federal entity that is most aware of the future of the sea level bodes poorly for the nation s future response to sea level rise according to the reuters report just a few hundred yards away from the northern tip of wallops island is another example of people s reluctance to change their habits in response to sea level rise in this case the government agency unlike nasa is trying to do the right thing but is frustrated by local people who fear the impact of change on their livelihood the very popular beach at chincoteague wildlife refuge on a narrow spit at the south end of assateague island virginia has a shell gravel parking lot that can handle cars the parking lot has been damaged repeatedly by a combination of storms and erosion at the rate of to feet per year in order to avoid the cost of repeated repairs and to maximize protection of the natural environment the u s fish and wildlife service has proposed replacing the beach parking with a shuttle system starting in the nearby town of chincoteague the locals exploded at this idea claiming it would destroy the local economy after much bitter debate the agency agreed to build a smaller and temporary parking lot on a more stable beach but it did not promise to repair storm damage to the new lot even when no buildings are threatened the pressures to hold the line against sea level rise can be insurmountable

1,what americans didn t hear about during brexit social security and medicare are in trouble it may be no shock to anyone who regularly browses these forums but with baby boomers now retiring our retirement system is in deep gt so after my grandkids went home i took a look at the report and sure enough on page i found the numbers i was looking for they showed that the treasury has had to borrow more than billion from investors over the past three years to keep social security s retirement and disability checks from bouncing gt the report doesn t say this outright in fact if you do a superficial read it looks like the system is doing better than ever because its trust fund its supposed reserve to meet future shortfalls is the biggest it s ever been gt but parse the numbers and you see that the system is taking in far less cash from social security taxes and from the taxes that higher income people like my wife and i pay on our benefits than it s spending and the trustees warn that this trend is projected to increase barring changes gt i just want to show you that social security is a financial problem for taxpayers and our society now despite the fact that the trust fund keeps getting larger the problem will become more obvious in a few years when social security s cash deficit begins to exceed the interest it s supposedly earning on its supposed trust fund but the problem is upon us right now

1,we re living in the matrix i was watching that movie again recently and was struck by how apt morpheus early description of the matrix is when compared to our own reality he states the matrix is all around us intertwined seamlessly with all aspects of human lives it enslaves us all with the vast majority completely unaware of its existence those working within the matrix are so totally under it s sway that they will fight to defend the very system that enslaves them once you know about the matrix it is impossible to return to willful ignorance so what is our matrix while i suppose it s remotely possible that we are actually in a simulation or are npcs in a video game i propose that our matrix is not something so intangible our matrix is money think about it money is seamlessly intertwined into every aspect of modern life it is near impossible to go a day without using it almost all of our interactions with other people are driven by it we don t build our houses ourselves we pay for the land then we pay for the construction then we pay the taxes there is no other way to do it within our system and to most people this arrangement seems ok it s easier to use the product of your own labour your pay to purchase the product of someone else s labour were money merely a representation of labour things might be more simple but our monetary system has been corrupted has jeff bezos really laboured as much as his net worth indicates where does the money the fed loans out come from who laboured to create it money has become abstracted and inflated currency and money are no longer necessarily the same thing billionaires increases their wealth digitally not by pouring truckfulls of bank notes into their vaults and yet we still need this illusory money to pay our medical bills buy our groceries and raise our children most people reject the idea of trying to live without money and even treat those that do as hippies moochers or communists those with money will defend the importance of money as they have already been bewildered and ensnared it it once you become sceptical about money it becomes impossible to regain that blind trust over a decade ago i stopped saving money using every paycheck to buy long lasting necessities my bank account lies dormant only used to pay bills i just don t trust digital money anymore paper isn t much better but at least it s more tangible i am often called irresponsible for not having savings as my physical possessions are not as useful as raw cash i disagree and don t think my position will ever change yes i still need money yes i am still enslaved by it but i am aware and hate the position that i am in if you ll permit me to dive into conspiracy theory territory who s to say that modern money is not simply a tool for the wealthy to siphon vitality from the masses let s examine everyone s favourite billionaire mr bezos he has roughly billion dollars yes that is not all immediately usable the bulk is tied in with his stake in amazon liquid assets or no he is a preposterously wealthy individual does he labour for his wealth no doubt he has ambition and drive business is a cutthroat world let s now examine where his wealth comes from the value of amazon stock and how has that become so valuable through the expenditures of his users and the efficiency of the product countless people work inside the amazon machine moving boxes doing inventory sorting sales dealing with suppliers how are these people paid as contracted employees how does their pay reflect their individual contribution of labour they are paid the bare minimum that the company has to pay them if we continue with the matrix analogy they are the shaved and hairless human batteries fed the bare necessities through tubes so the machine can reap their energy what is done with all of this energy it is used to open new packing and sorting warehouses expand the global reach of the company convert more people into batteries that bezos can siphon and the amazing thing about it all they re lining up to work for him no one even knows or if they do their need for his illusory money is greater than their misgivings who rises to the top in the money matrix the parasites who are happy draining more and more batteries every year so that growth never slows down when the matrix begins to stutter and glitch people begin to lose faith in the system the architects pump for illusionary money into circulation more humans line up to become batteries for the privileged machines so that they too can be plugged in and allowed to dream that they may one day become something greater and how can anyone rebel the machines control the energy they have batteries to use and drain far more aggressively than anything the resistors could muster how can this parasitic system be dismantled i don t see it happening in my lifetime all i know is that the longer this corrupted program is allowed to run and spread the smaller and more urgent the window for effective change will be i really don t want to be some rich asshole s battery do you

1,the future of the precariats will be similar to those who were driven out during the enclosure movement sorry i have no encouraging words for precariats during the th th century there was something called enclosure movement in england long story short the landowners began to fence off enclose the formerly common land to graze sheep which was more profitable they were supported by the local baliffs police who killed any resisters and brutally evicted the farmers who had to leave with little more than the clothes they wore eventually the former farmers ended up in the cities where they provided the labor for the industrial revolution however gregory clark has found virtually all english alive now are descended from successful farmers during these era precisely those who evicted the hapless peasants and not from the lower class peasants who became city laborers the book great expectations based upon many observations of dickens shows how the lines of the peasants die out pip the protagonist had siblings but only the oldest sister and himself survive infancy the oldest sister married to a blacksmith joe gargery the equivalent to a small landowner something like a body shop owner now and better than a landless peasant is childless long story short pip ends up a bachelor and won t reproduce and that line will die joe gargery remarries after pip s sister dies and gets a son and names him pip to make sure pip will never reproduce so his line will continue english literature like jude the obscure is full of how the precariats and their descendants are weeded out from the gene pool all the way to the atonement and beyond circumstances differ and themes differ too but the conclusion of the precariat s genes taken out from the pool does not change at least the precariats of these era had some place to go now there will be no place to go for the billions of precariats since there will not be any decent jobs anymore history tells that the fate of the not chosen the outcasts is extinction

1,those who benefit by the system won t change it and will argue for the status quo against all evidence or public good for a very basic reason conviction follows self interest there s a lens that doesn t get applied enough to what s happening there s a relationship between the status quo meaning the way things are and are arranged and decision making and who gets to make those decisions interests line up according to who benefits from change and who benefits from preservation of the status quo the mega corporations that finance politics and send their kids to the same school as the majority of judges and doctors in the uk or the country clubs in the us enculturated one another into a natural bias about their lifestyle and identity as well as the politics of their context in our popular and broad cynicism about politics we overlook that billionaires and the mega wealthy are similarly cynical to them as evidenced in their words and actions politics is contained by formal and informal rules as a vehicle to decide who has power over the status quo that s why so much money in politics is spent on advertising and get out the vote political dorks often point out advertising doesn t do much for convincing people but the power of marketing is enough to make it a multi billion dollar industry and if politics is won by hard won inches every bit of spending on campaigns matter they matter because we have a democratic system and no matter how cynical we are about it who gets in to office has access to resources and power over the frameworks of the way things are and are arranged that s why networks form around candidates sensing the opportunity to influence changing the status quo to something more favourable for their interests as cynical as people are about democracy don t be an idiot mega corporations and most billionaires also cynically use democracy while everyone else pins their hopes on a politician saying the right thing having the right ideas for direction and policy and then following through once in power it s that power of rhetoric and marketing that persuades regular people to continually vote for rich cocksuckers who don t give a fuck about you that s part of the relationship between decision making and interests and the status quo in a democracy the voting public and their opinions are a source of power but their opinions matter most when it s actioned irl through voting we forget that fox news was explicitly created for the purpose of influencing public opinion in order to advance and preserve special interests all the cynicism about media telling people what to believe is absolutely true but much of is not constructive or nuanced influencing public opinion to believe their self interest lies in what is fed to them is how vested interests keep democracies from voting into power the kinds of deep change that are needed to avoid  it s why so many americans froth over biden s communism and misdirect their blame and anger at liberals that opinion is actioned irl by voting republican that conviction was cultivated by a steady media diet and enculturation in families it s why think tanks and media outlets and blogs and events and politicians all disseminate what is believed to advance or preserve their set of interests people fight harder for a sense of identity than they would a foundationally fallible opinion about what rate the minimum wage should be that meme about anything i don t like is communism could easily be anything billionaires don t like they frame as big evil to convince the masses to discard out of hand an alternative status quo conviction follows self interest voters fighting for identity politicians fighting for status and power billionaires fighting for their self assured worldview being quite literally at the top of the world people argue with conviction what they believe is in their interest that s an important reason to savage the rhetoric by exxon mobil or any politician that claims the future is the cure like australia s scott morrison basically going technology not taxes whose interests is he representing

1,ecological  and the th problem in soto zen buddhism there is a concept known as the th problem there is a similar story in theravada canon but it does not specify a number but ends with the same conclusion in this a farmer hearing that the buddha was a great teacher and solver of problem decided when the buddha meditating on his own to waylay him under a tree the buddha being very good willed decided to hear out the farmer s many problems with life the farmer for example told him that he had a very good wife but she can be naggy sometime the rain does come in due season except it came slightly earlier this year making one of his crops not do well after spending the time between noon to sunset listening to the man s problem under the tree the buddha ended the meeting by saying i am afraid i cannot help you the farmer was shocked and said i thought you are the great teacher and you can solve all problems the buddha shook his head and said every human being has a minimum of problems at any one time if you try to solve one problem very hard sure you might solve it but in turn another problem will pop up in its place there is nothing you can do about it the theravada story does not specify a number but rather goes that there are some problems in life which are very hard to resolve and even if it is resolved results in a new problem in its place the story also does not suggest the buddha spent half a day listening to the man s problems angered the farmer said what is the use of your teaching then maybe so you may know the th problem the buddha said oh great what is the th problem the man said you do not want to have any problems the buddha replied i think our modern day issue with  is the same it is essentially the result of us not wanting a particular problem so we work very hard to resolve that problem trouble is a lot of our problems are in fact problems that are hard to resolve they can be resolved but instantly it pops another problem in its place it is quite possible that the original human problems prior technology was something that nature can cope with but we find it hard to deal with we have actually solved most of the original problems but with it a new problems have popped into place unlike before we are struggling to cope with it this is why society and nature is collapsing just a thought

1,quote from isaac asimov s foundation novel which seems relevant to  gt the fall of empire gentlemen is a massive thing however and not easily fought it is dictated by a rising bureaucracy a receding initiative a freezing of caste a damming of curiosity a hundred other factors it has been going on as i have said for centuries and it is too majestic and massive a movement to stop rising bureaucracy it s harder than ever to get anything done because of all the rules laws and regulations preventing one from enacting change from updating the laws from doing anything meaningful the rules were once put in place to make things fair and to serve the people now they re in place to protect those already in positions of power receding initiative nobody wants to do anything anymore nobody wants to think of something new because it s too hard to fight the momentum of the status quo we recycle and recirculate old technologies because we ve forgotten how to invent new ones the problems of today seem too big and so we don t take any initiative don t forget though that splitting the atom once seemed impossible that flight was impossible that going to the moon was impossible hell even sailing across an ocean seemed impossible at one point we just lack the initiative now because we ve been told a lie that others will invent and create what is necessary we ve been indoctrinated school community society and kept placated just enough to eat just enough to stay sheltered just enough to numb just enough to survive to believe that we shouldn t try a freezing of caste is evident the rich wealthy class are digging into their positions and getting even richer whilst the middle class gets pushed into the poorer class we have our pseudo technology to make us believe we re better off whilst those technologies degrade our critical thinking abilities and on average make us feel worse seriously who feels good after browsing facebook or instagram who feels happier after scrolling through twitter and we are not curious we never ask why or how anymore we just accept and put on a fake smile and blink we don t ask because we don t want to know because we re not curious we ve been told that curiosity killed the cat and we don t want to die instead we look to others to tell us how to think i ve spoken to so many people lately who when i ask them a question that is subjective has no right or wrong answer they start quoting other people they quote celebrities or politicians they quote studies and journals and magazines i didn t ask them what others think i asked them what they thought and they weren t curious at all for all their intellect they didn t have an original thought so we are in the midst of the fall of the  there s no way to fight it but we don t have to live it stay curious keep showing initiative invent question and by all means think think about everything think deeply and think passionately think morally and ethically think even if it hurts especially if it hurts thought is the last thing the  will be able to take from us
1,might we see a future with self driving solar e rvs that can relocate away from disaster in a future world where random extreme weather events can destroy property and infrastructure could a more mobile way of life be the answer if you take a modern rv and give it a solar roof and awning as well as making it electrically powered then you have an erv home that can be relocated when a super storm comes to town or if there is a economic or civil disruption to the area you live in a self driving solar e rv would give you the cruise liner benefit of allowing you to relocate as you sleep waking up in a new location away from danger additional benefits of a solar powered erv are power disruptions shortages or rushes on the local fuel supply will not hinder you so could even a  prone extreme weather future be offset by an e rv

1,inability to adapt is anyone else irreversibly screwed in life and see further societal disruption along with its eventual  as only compounding an already terminal situation i made a similar thread here just about a couple years ago now and in that case decided to delete it since as some had pointed out it seemed to be largely inappropriate or only tangentially related to  as a whole i felt stupid amp embarrassed as a result rightfully so and thought the best thing was just to get rid of it i was also rather overwhelmed by all the responses i got which itself only served to stoke my anxiety leading me to run away amp hide amp pretend it never happened i screen capped the thread just so i could fully read it at some later point after my anxiety had died down it was a few months afterwards that i finally worked up the nerve to read what had been written by everybody it s actually been a great source of comfort for me to be honest i just wanted to say thanks i guess it s all wasted on the likes of me but i can t but appreciate it nonetheless it s allowed me to forget my worthlessness for a bit at times and even more foolishly think i have some value it s not true amp it never will be but it s okay since i can keep the delusion in my pocket like a small faded little treasure i m really a humiliating mess please don t take my self absorbed ramblings as being anything that should be associated with  or whatever else is out there anyway personally speaking i m still unmerrily sailing my way out to sea it s now almost years since i ve been a hikikomori with very little having changed since the last time i let all this mental diarrhea of mine slosh over the toilet bowl of my mind i wish i could ve taken the advice of everyone but it s hopeless and i gave up on myself amp the world a long long time ago it s all rendered moot when faced against what is put simply my highest aspiration working up the courage to commit suicide i ve fantasized about it for years at this point and in all that time amp more have thought about it every day at least once i m not cutout for any of this society nature life it makes no difference i just want to be free from wanting feeling or thinking anything i don t have the strength or the willpower to exist beyond these plaster walls amp dusty curtains and i never will i don t wish for the  or any kind of suffering on anyone but i m so tired i just want some sleep and i d pay someone good money to put a pillow over my face and give it to me this is who i am there is no salvation from this no answer no solution the world will always be this way to me futility amp suffering it s an intractable reality we all share and i can t and have never been able to cope with it if only i had been a victim of nazi germany s t program a guaranteed execution to stymie my weakness monstrous jackboots turned savior a kind reaper in disguise thank you goodbye what wonderful last words as a paradoxical segue juxtaposition to it all reading the nhk manga for the first time back in march april of last year helped me lose weight begin exercising everyday and immensely improve my diet oddly enough i ve also seen the anime and enjoyed it but it didn t leave the same huge impression on me anyway i don t know i guess reading it somehow spurred a daesu oh style transformation in me to engage in something different with my time irregardless of the additional health benefits and more out of the inherent novelty as i m locked in my own particular space the way he was in his i m also not ashamed to admit that a part of me wanted to embody the character of satou from nhk in a physical sense as being a slim bordering on emaciated at certain intervals stick figure and have misaki cheer me on in my own head as i do it almost as if that if i could somehow enter that world i d need to be as slim as satou otherwise it just wouldn t work amp the continuity would be missing for lack of a better way to describe it the decision for me to start eating only one meal a day actually came from one of the later chapters of the manga where satou is starving himself i also exercised pretty much every day for about months straight started out with intense cardio on our treadmill but then switched to doing mostly strength related kettlebell exercises among other miscellaneous exercises after the tread started to irreparably stick amp stop in the beginning i cried a lot after exercising because of how much it made me think of misaki and how lonely i was still am after a while i chose to stop because i ended up experiencing what is known as etd eustachian tube dysfunction which caused my left ear to periodically plug up like crazy my exercises seemed to make it flare up more than usual but even if i didn t do them it still happened after trying many sprays amp finding no earwax to remove i came to the conclusion that the natural fat pad in that ear that helps regulate the eustachian tube must ve become abnormally emaciated given how much weight i had lost in such a short period of time and so i needed to let my body acclimate to the new normal and thus take a break from the exercises that was until a few weeks ago in which i began doing them again in the end it was and still is just something to do a useless gesture with no real meaning aside from killing time and to distract me from myself yeah i lost weight and got a bit in shape but so what i m still locked away inside this house with no dreams or desires for the future aside from hoping to die as soon as possible i m more physically fit amp limber i suppose but i never leave the house and i have nowhere to go so what s the point i still feel just as shitty as ever it s all so useless i also ordered some phoenix tears thc concentrate which i took alone in my room until i started to panic and my parents helped me through it a couple months prior to my shift in routine and before reading the manga after having never tried a drug of any sort before not even alcohol and i d have to say that also played a not so small part in it all it was a deeply unpleasant experience filled with palpable doom amp anxiety laced with moments of profound insight that eventually led to me suffering from bouts of recurring derealization which thankfully subsided after a few weeks i ve vaped some indica strains a few times since with more or less the same results as a result i ll probably never partake in it nor anything similar to it ever again but i can t deny how it probably played a large role into doing what i ended up doing it really turned me off drugs as a whole and i m too frightened to try anything else i just can t handle it as an aside cbd strains had no effect on me whatsoever the other big change for me was only eating one meal a day like i already mentioned and removing all the sugar laden shit from my diet which in my case wasn t really that much since even when i was overweight i absolutely hated and never had soda or most kinds of sweets junk food amp pastries the worst thing that kept me fat by far personally speaking was chocolate milk and more or less having a glass of it after every meal just dropping that alone made a huge difference to me and i probably would ve been at a much more stable weight years prior had i just gotten rid of it sooner the only thing i drink nowadays is water and occasionally some almond milk when i feel like having a bowl of oatmeal i also dropped eating any kind of bread as well and haven t had a slice of bread or a single piece of fast food junk food since when i started last year i ve also reduced my meat dairy intake considerably as well and haven t eaten beef or pork since last year as well from that point on i ve only eaten the healthy meals my mother makes for me just lots of vegetables rice lean meats fish amp chicken and other similar things all whipped up at home i don t know how to cook for shit and have no desire to learn so i d certainly be screwed without her which itself could be said about many other things as well irregardless i m grateful for the effort she makes each day to feed me whole reason she actually started cooking for me in the first place was because she thought i was going to starve to death if she didn t given how little i began to eat to this day she still thinks the same really came to like brussel sprouts amp broccoli funnily enough after finally trying them for the first time it also helps that i have an extremely weak digestive system which more often than i d like made eating junk food fast food a literal hell since it d be left up to a coin toss whether or not i d then end up getting crippling gut cramps later on the kind that have you bowled over on the floor pretty much totally incapacitated anyway like i said i ve begun exercising once more and am hoping that the etd i previously mentioned doesn t arise again i also wish my mom could find the willpower to start to lose weight herself she s quite old amp obese and i worry for her health if she were to die my life would take a major turn for the worse in more ways than i could even begin to explain it s bound to happen someday though lord knows i won t be prepared for it then again i might manage to experience the problem that japan has right now where year old parents are looking after year old hikikomori it s estimated that middle aged people between to are living as hikikomori in japan just think of how many people that is so many lost souls who never found a way out why should i be any different it d be arrogant to think so either way it s academic since whether i like it or not that s where i m headed thrash against the quick sand or don t either way you ll still sink maybe society will  before i get that far i don t know a part of me wishes i had started a blog or something so people could be entertained at how much of a lowly freak i am but i can t find the energy or the words sorry for all this i m making the same mistake again by posting this here beyond this place and here i don t go anywhere else sorry it s all vomit to be cleaned up ultimately i m not going to seek help i m not going to go outside and i m not going to do anything beyond the small things i ve already done while remaining indoors it s bleak amp it s shitty amp it runs contrary to what people expect to hear but that s the truth you can t save everyone nor can everyone be capable of saving themselves i m just one of probably tens of millions who s going down with the ship in their own unique way even beyond the  of industrial life amp the biosphere however it s been estimated that there have been billion humans who have ever lived on this planet that s such a staggering figure to me how many sad empty lives bereft of relief or salvation from themselves have there been i wonder more than most would care to admit i m just another regrettable example of the many who ve circled a similar drain in life watching it all slowly ebb way sometimes even in the beginning it s already too late it s certainly tragic but life is full to the brim with that light a candle shed a tear or shrug your shoulders and scoff for the perpetually lonely amp lost it makes little difference throwing out a message in a bottle as i slosh around in the cold water on the deck only for it to crash against the railing leaving the glass shard ridden note to fly back in my face blood trickling from my face i can t help but smile at the insane uselessness amp absurdity of myself that s all this amounts to in the end sorry for the bullshit and walls of text
1,a troubling thought i have come to accept the situation of  and global warming as inevitable and catastrophic but these events are still not enough to explain a mass extinction event for the planet as long as we make changes and adapt i think the real cause of mass exctinction may be triggered in what we are observing in the acidification of ocean waters this would be where the precipitation that brings rain to life on land originates and would be acidifying the soil at the same rate i don t know much about how acidity affects the plants and soil but i know localized acid rain produces devistating results if the positive feedback loops we are observing continue to acidify the oceans then that will inevitably lead to uninhabitable oceans teeming with jellyfish and the intense storms formed by warm oceans will bring the rains that will spread that acidity onto the land as well it s just a thought but it makes sense to me that it could cause much more severe damage than temperature or sea level rise in the coming decades anyone have any insight or knowledge about if this is at all a possibility

1,what are the rich doing about climate change and inevitable  this year i ve really noticed the insane shift in weather and with it i ve had a strange pit in my stomach like this is the beginning of something very bad over the weekend i started researching what i found was so awful i had to keep looking mostly to disprove or find the silver lining but it kept getting worse and worse and worse the final straw for me was seeing the leaked ipcc report reading they re extremely conservative with their reports and seeing c at best we re fucked and all the information is readily available after a few google searches all the hopes i had for my future are gone i never planned on having children but knowing how different my near future will be is a very bitter pill but there s one thing i still can t get my head around before the pandemic i wouldn t believe that the general public could be so stupid unaware blas short sighted selfish full of denial etc now i understand i put entirely too much faith in humanity but what about the super rich if i can count on anything it s human greed and a need to survive i don t expect them to save the planet but if the whole planet goes down they re going down too and their money and their families c is devastating i can sort of understand if they think nothing will change for another years but in hour of research i found that was false and i m an average person don t they have people around them to inform them are they secretly building bunkers are they falling in to the same denial as the common folk i find it so hard to believe that someone with gobs of money access opportunity etc could be blind to what s going on when i being a normal person figured it out in a short span of time they could even use their money to push the issue make people more aware under the guise of doing good and buy stocks in solar panels or whatever they tell people to go buy capitalism and consumerism is at the root of this and it s unsettling to me that none of them are using it to their advantage either to raise awareness and save the planet from becoming a fiery shitty wasteland or to make a bunch of money and gain more control as we continue our journey in to the fiery shitty wasteland the people at the top use these systems to manipulate on the daily so surely they don t fall in to the same trap of people don t do anything about climate change  because of capitalism and consumerism and media lying or downplaying does elon musk think we ll get to space before shit hits the fan jeff bezos what s bill gates doing all the tech millionaires and billionaires sorry if this isn t allowed or has been answered before i see a lot about why normal people don t pay more attention but didn t see much about the super rich people at the top

yale heat blobs called rossby waves are killing fish and seabirds these blobs will destroy human food security by causing intermittent intense droughts floods and storms world water demand is in

organs of humans internal combustion engines emit nano magnets that enter inside your brain through your nose and cause alzheimer s symptoms in youth car tire and brake nano particles attack the human body in ways we re just beginning to understand nano particles are in all the food water and air that enters our bodies through our skin lungs and guts to attack our brains and vital organs most

thousands of varieties plastics do not recycle they become nano particles which are highly attracted to nano particles of metals and toxins the reason we got here is because of the myopic dishonest business model of academia which has been going on since carnegies and rockefellers started corrupting them years ago with conditional grants there are billion chickens on earth and just of all mammals are wildlife we are on track to lose half of that in years carbon capture cannot be scaled up effectively in time zero gravity destroys human brains and eyes and leads to blood clots in your

1,how sudden could abrupt climate change happen the common feature of most articles on future climate change is the year but some scientists have put forward that our complex system will not follow a nice graceful curve up to a new higher temperature level over the course of a century or more they put forward that our climate system is the interplay of lots of interacting chaotic systems clouds rain snow ice tides ocean circulations glaciers ice caps forests jungles deserts and cities not to mention the occasional butterfly so in theory once a threshold or tipping point is passed the climate can flip suddenly to a new normal in the permian triassic mass extinction event the climate jumped to c warmer wiping out about of all life on earth and we are all working together every day all billion of us to warm up the planet and it s working so the question is how suddenly could we trigger abrupt climate change and what will be the first signs that we have triggered an extinction level event

1,the american infrastructure ancient rome and limits to growth kurt cobb infrastructure is the talk of the town in washington d c where i now live and with good reason the infrastructure upon which the livelihoods and lives of all americans depends is in sorry shape the american society of civil engineers infrastructure report card gives the united states an overall grade of c minus everyone in washington yes everyone believes some sort of major investment needs to be made in our transportation water and sewer systems which have been sorely neglected there are other concerns as well about our energy infrastructure and our communications infrastructure both of which are largely in private hands the wrangling over how much will be spent and on what is likely to go on for months what won t be talked about is that the cost of maintaining our infrastructure is rising for one key reason there s more it every day we keep expanding all these systems so that when they degrade and require maintenance and replacement the cost keeps growing there is a lesson on this from ancient rome few modern people understand that the romans financed their expansion and government operations using the booty taken from vanquished territories that worked until it didn t when rome reached its maximum expanse when it no longer conquered new territories the booty stopped coming with the borders of rome the longest the empire had ever had to defend it now relied primarily on taxes to finance a large army and administrative presence across the empire in order to maintain control our modern day version of booty has been cheap energy much of it supplied by the oil natural gas and coal fields of america and later its uranium mines that cheap energy and other previously cheap resources have been increasingly elusive since the year even though periodic s in prices have given us the illusion that somehow we will get back to the status quo ante moreover we kept adding infrastructure of all types including the traditional roads bridges ports airports and the advanced fiber optic satellites and wireless we stand where the romans were at the peak of their empire the cost to maintain our infrastructure keeps climbing we have a modern piece of analysis that puts the problem in relief though most people have misinterpreted its message the message comes from limits to growth an assessment of our economic prospects based on resource use and capital constraints what limits to growth foresaw is now unfolding the limit the writers were talking about wasn t strictly speaking a limit on resources but rather a limit on available capital this is because before a system can expand it must first be maintained what is happening right before our eyes is that our infrastructure is degrading and we are falling further and further behind in maintaining it instead we are living off our capital so to speak at some point all of our capital expenditures will go toward simply maintaining the current system with no funds left over for expansion that is the primary limit on growth and that is the inevitable outcome for an economic system that is based on the idea of perpetual expansion to quote economist herbert stein if something cannot go on forever it will stop the same holds true for the broader industrial commercial and residential infrastructure the idea that we might need to downsize our expectations and our infrastructure to avoid a sudden destabilizing reversal is not only unmentionable in the mainstream media and in policy circles it is unthinkable but rome did the unthinkable having become ungovernable because of its vast size and complexity emperor diocletian split the empire in two in a d appointing a co emperor to rule the western empire while diocletian ruled the eastern empire this may be the only example in history of an empire voluntarily splitting itself into parts in this case explicitly to increase stability and improve governance the downsizing and splitting of power seemed to work the western empire lasted almost another two centuries falling to invaders in the eastern empire which became known as the byzantine empire endured until nearly a thousand years beyond its sister empire the solution to america s infrastructure crisis does not lie in further expansion consolidation and decentralization might be a better course if we can define what that means and create a fairer system for distributing the resulting fruits but alas i do not think consolidation and decentralization are on the menu this year in the infrastructure debate if we look to history we can see where heedless expansion leads namely to a forced decentralization and fragmentation that is far more wrenching than the voluntary bifurcation classical rome experienced it seems america with the world following close behind will continue a policy of endless expansion until expansion cannot continue what happens after that history tells us will not be pleasant source
1,this is the year of  as was in mcpherson predicted the usa s trucking industry would  by due to peak oil quickly followed by the interstate highway system in he predicted the end of civilization by due to peak oil if you re alive in a decade it will be because you ve figured out how to forage locally in he predicted that global warming will kill much of humanity by in he predicted that humanity and most lifeforms will be extinct due to global warming by mid in he predicted that global temperatures would be c above baseline in mid and that earth would have no atmosphere by the s in june he implied that industrial civilization was about to  in september followed by a degree c immediate additional temperature jump due to the end of reflective aerosol production which would rapidly somehow end all complex multicellular organisms on earth

1,american decadence and covid i have hesitated to give a take on covid not only because there are too many takes on it already but since the science appears at least to me to be in perpetual flux and i have no expertise in the field that said i want to take some time to talk not about the virus itself but about its apocalyptic that is revelatory meaning for our politics and culture america is or perhaps has been for a while decedent as nietzsche says when it comes to decadence gt a society is not free to remain young and even at the height of its strength it has to form refuse and waste materials the more energetically and boldly it advances the richer it will be in failures and deformities the closer to decline age is not abolished by means of institutions neither is disease nor vice nietzsche in the above passage is in part drawing attention to the tension between the material and cultural prosperity of a society and the fact that this prosperity comes with it a higher level degeneration paradoxically to some the greater the societal advancement the closer it is to decline it is from this point of departure that i want to make a few observation about america at this point politically the polarization of the country and the displacement of legislative power is showing itself clearly in our institutional politics that is for years now the legislative branch of government at least at the federal level has given more power over to the executive branch and the judiciary the increasing use of executive orders by each president the ability of the president to act almost unilaterally with regard to foreign affairs and the only check on his power not coming from legislative overwrite but from challenges made from courts has weakened the principle of the separation of powers that has been a fundamental pillar of american government this institutional dysfunction and ossification has manifested itself in the recent break down in the coronavirus relief package and the subsequent use of executive orders by trump the second problem that we have is the omnipresence of pseudo politics in no domain in no area of life can we be freed from the thick miasma of political mist watch a sport politicized drive by a neighborhood politicized take a walk and one hears the background mummers of politics the problem though is the omnipresence of political performance is not the same as the actual substance of political action the performative and aesthetic saturation of the culture with politics masks that fact that institutionally and organizationally the power of american criticizes has been weakened virtual exuberance and organizational displays are not the language of power cf the sanders campaign for this truth the final area of decadence that i want to such on here is medical yes one could speak about the financialized medical system and the fact that some hospital were losing a great deal of money during parts of the lockdown due to the elective procedures that they weren t able to execute a truly sad state of affairs but i want to talk about different issues our obesity studies repeatably show that covid impacts the overweight and obese much more than others the phenomenon of obesity is a systemic one and the though language of personal responsibility must have some place here too the fact that of the nation is obese speaks to something structural obesity is the externalization of decadence the bodily incarnation of societal sickness if decadence is a high degree of decline from within the context of an advanced civilization then few phenomena speaks to it more than obesity our lives being choked from us through our own luxury the overproduction of material resources and comfort made possible by technological dynamism being the very thing that brings us to destruction america is growing old not only in terms of median age but in terms of prosperity and institutional vitality finally there is uneasiness setting in for many this situation is of course a genuine crisis but the fear and many have a right to be fearful is that this crisis will indeed go to waste there are many who hope that out of this this situation will come a transformative moment but they harbor doubts in their hearts and they should for transformation to happen the social conditions must be right but there also must be enough of the right kinds of people to carry it out is a nation of the obese the aging the tired capable of this the fear is not only that we are decedent but that the trend is irreversible and that we no longer have what it takes to change
1,a future planet with wet bulb dead zones this year is breaking a lot of heat related records and heat waves can be deadly but there is another factor that can make a heatwave unsurvivable high humidity the wet bulb temperature is simply the temp of a thermometer wrapped in a wet cloth this simulates the apparent temperature a person who is perspiring to cool down feels the danger limit is when very high humidity is combined with gt c temperatures and perspiration no longer cools people down regardless of how fit you are unless you are able to find something external to cool you down you will overheat and die as your body s own cooling mechanism does not work when the humidity is too high equatorial coastal regions will be the areas that are most likely to experience these conditions as our climate warms up and is therefore able to carry more moisture in the form of humidity we are already seeing very high temperatures and increased humidity levels so it is only a matter of time before this deadly duo start turning up and causing devastation in unprepared regions of the world as temperatures continue to rise expect to see no go wet bulb dead zones appearing on our world maps at least regions without air conditioning systems so check that your next luxury holiday location has a c preferable powered by renewable energy sources good article on the rise of wet bulb temps gt noaa wet bulb temperature calculator gt prof steve sherwood wet bulb temp gt
1,coping with  meditation hello r  this subreddit gives many people cause to re evaluate their lives and how they related to the world it also appears to cause much suffering in people that are don t know how to move forward with this new understanding suffering is a constant in the world we live in and if we re right it s going to get worse how then are we expected to make our way in the world among people who appear to be largely ignorant of the danger we re in going to our jobs and having dinner with our parents each of us has to find a way to do this today i m going to share what worked for me meditation i ll cover in this post some tips on how to start a meditation practice and keep it going i ll also start off with a bit of an explanation of what meditation is what you should expect from your meditation practice and how that might help you cope with your knowledge of  i have over the course of the or so years that i ve been moderating this subreddit had many occasions for reflection on whether what i do hurts or helps the people that come here we have all seen posts from people that seem to be on the edge struggling mightily with the ideas here this post is partly a mental salve for me i ll admit it s also genuine i believe wholeheartedly that you all could benefit from meditation as i have please keep an open mind and give this a try especially if you re depressed or feeling like you cannot continue why meditation we suffer here beating ourselves up endlessly about what will likely one day be known as the last decades of western civilization and potentially the last great dying on the only planet we know to be habitable for all of that though our suffering is still suffering and is therefore not terribly unique long ago when times were much tougher than they are now when persian kings built empires and rome was still a backwater in a place that wouldn t be called italy until millennia later there was probably a person named gotama who sat under a tree and meditated on human suffering for weeks as he did this he was enlightened and when he arose he began teaching a way to end suffering today this way is called the four noble truths and it forms the basis of the spiritual practice we now call buddhism buddhism and the practice of meditation which forms the cornerstone of buddhist practice came from a time and place when suffering death and carnage were far more prevalent civilizations rose and d countless times and the people in those civilizations had to endure those hardships that come about from  knowing that buddhist practice arose during such times makes it uniquely qualified to help me and potentially some of you find their own way through what s to come whether you integrate meditation practice into a larger spiritual context or whether you approach it separately as a self improvement exercise is of course up to you your life will probably be the better for it either way what is meditation meditation is cheap easy to do and most anyone with a set of lungs and an ass to sit on can do it when one meditates one is making a conscious effort to focus their awareness on a meditation object sometimes this is a mantra or an image or idol or as in my practice it is simply the breath meditation is a skill that needs to be practiced in order for you to realize its benefits a meditation session on the occasional weekend or when you re in the mood every so often will simply not do when you learn a musical instrument you practice every day a student who practices their instrument daily will excel where a student who does not will fall behind and become discouraged for their lack of progress since i have begun my own practice i ve found it easier to relate to what s going on in the world around me i ve been better able to piece together an understanding of my mind and how it works my emotions and how i relate to the people in my life i ve been able to do this because meditation is a bit of a hack when you meditate you focus on the breath and then as your mind naturally wanders you correct it and try to return your awareness to the breath in doing this you build an awareness of what your mind is doing at any given time most of us going through our daily lives rarely have any lasting awareness of our thoughts and emotions in a given situation meditation forces you to build this awareness and the consequences of it can be profound i hope this gives you a bit of background i also know that my meager description of this simple and transformative practice falls well short of the mark simply put i cannot accurately describe in words the changes that have taken place in my life as a direct result of my practice moreover it seems to have staying power i have done many things over the course of my life to try to improve myself but i ve always found myself putting these things down and returning to my own status quo usually cyclical depression and alcoholism followed unpredictably by short periods of relative calm and motivation how to meditate find a time in your schedule for meditation many people find that meditating in the morning works best for them i find myself in that camp after work or school your mental energy is largely sapped and it can be difficult to attain the focus necessary for meditation once you ve decided to meditate at a certain time of day try to keep to that time and practice to help get you going you can make use of a meditation timer many now include achievements that gameify the experience and help you keep motivated i ll include a list of good meditation timers that you can use towards the end of the post sit comfortably legs crossed with your back straight if you can don t bother twisting yourself into full lotus if it is painful or uncomfortable some buddhist traditions like zen emphasize a particular posture or way of sitting these postures are difficult and discouraging to the beginner so sit as you normally would a pillow under the ass or a yoga mat can help and you re encouraged to use these if you find you can t sit for long periods of time cross legged on the floor sit in a chair avoid meditating laying down or in bed every time i ve attempted to do this i fall asleep or i m unable to keep my concentration for long set your meditation timer for to minutes and start it now try to find your breath you re looking for the sensations associated with breathing the coolness warmness in your nose or on your upper lip when you inhale and exhale work well alternately you can try to find the breath in the abdomen as your stomach moves in and out with the breath try to remain as aware as possible of these sensations as you breath breath normally or as normally as you can since awareness of the breath will often disrupt your normal autonomic breathing your mind will wander and you ll find yourself thinking about other things try to recognize when this happens and then move your awareness back to the breath don t get discouraged if this happens often because it will these first couple of days of meditation will be difficult but it will become easier remember meditation is a skill and you will get better at it as you do it increase the length of your session to to minutes when you feel ready i would suggest not trying longer sessions of minutes to an hour unless you feel comfortable it is easy to get discouraged in these early stages so keep your practice small and grow it slowly apps and further reading the mind illuminated a bare bones meditation manual designed for western audiences this book has helped me greatly in developing and furthering my practice the introductory chapters of this book will help you decide whether you want to start a daily meditation practice and the rest of it will give you a much better idea of how to go about it than what i ve said here the audiobook version is free with an audible trial if you re interested audio dharma a collection of talks from a buddhist podcast called zencast out of the states with a really great introduction to meditation since buddhism was an entirely aural tradition from its inception i find listening to dharma talks easier and more authentic than reading about it alan watts makes at least one appearance here as well and it s worth a listen you can find zencast on your favorite podcast app as well the three pillars of zen a less secular approach to help you cultivate a zen buddhist practice if you choose to pursue it this is the book that after sitting on my bookshelf for almost a decade inspired me to make a diligent effort at meditation practice skip the author s introductory materials and jump right into chapter r meditation and r themindilluminated subreddits dedicated to these topics meditation as a topic has been co opted by woo peddlers the world over so don t be discouraged if you find people that are far out on these subs the best way to engage them is to ask for help in your practice if you re having trouble you will they ll usually have good advice to give meditation timer amp log android based meditation timer includes achievements and milestones black lotus android and black lotus ios another good meditation timer for ios and android headspace in addition to a meditation timer and log this app includes guided meditations and sleep exercises it is a subscription based service and an expensive one at that but the free tier has introductory meditation and mindfulness lessons that you might find valuable when starting out

1,why do you think scandinavians are more egalitarian than people in other cultures political systems i have always wonder how danish people are more egalitarian than people in most other cultures some reasons i thought of myself is maybe their political system allows them to express egalitarian ideas and policies not because they are more egalitarian but simply because their political system of referendums and such allows them to express and develop egalitarian views and policies i do not really know the political system of denmark well enough to know why or maybe it is their culture of minimalism less is more bike riding lifestyle any thoughts

1,a catastrophic solar storm and resulting magnetic reversal event is going to hit us hard in the next years i think this should be getting as much if not more attention than climate change and it s possible that intelligence agencies have known for decades i believe we re going to see a magnetic reversal catastrophe in our lifetime on a scale that humans haven t experienced for around years as a brief overview of what a magnentic reversal is astronomy com states occasionally the earth s magnetic field s intensity will diminish and the dip poles will stray far from the geographic poles sometimes the dip poles will even swap hemispheres in which case the polarity of earth s magnetic field will have reversed this does not happen periodically in some ways reversals occur randomly the result of chaotic dynamics in earth s core the last time earth s geomagnetic polarity reversed was about years ago this statement fails to mention that solar activity can also induce magnetic changes here on earth when the magnetic field flips or weakens the charged particles that the sun farts out are going to break through to us more easily causing radiation sickness burns etc and the earth s magnetic field s intensity is most definitely diminishing amp xb and the poles are most definitely moving amp xb many of you who study climate change will be used to the cloying promises of pacifying academics and publications who say everything will be fine but anomalies associated with magnetic changes seem to be becoming more and more common here s more evidence pigeons are disappearing in races orcas are attacking boats in spain at least occurrences since march in unheard of attacks elephants are travelling far away from home on bizarre journeys amp xb i hope this post is ok here i m not a climate skeptic at all rather the opposite i just believe the sun may be a bigger and more imminent threat that i never see anyone discussing when i bring this topic up with friends and family they don t even know magnetic pole shifts are a thing i find the topic both horrifying and fascinating in the way that scientists seem to have far less of an understanding of the nature of reversal

1,why does nobody talk about nuclear weapons anymore they re such a huge problem i haven t seen much posting about it on here but to me they re an equal issue to climate change i know some people are nuclear deniers who believe that nuclear weapons promote peace but is that the prevailing view here i ve never been able to stop thinking about nuclear war politicians rarely talk about general military disarmament and i don t think the us presidential candidates even have nuclear disarmament in their platform though i ve seen some answer questions about it that s hardly in their platform it s been years since we started to realize these weapons are bad and the movements against them seem dead

1,nuclear power plants big clusterfuck if not maintained for around a year now im kinda concerned after getting up to speed with science on climate change i dont think there are words to describe in how deep shit we are currently that out of the way i feel like our system doesnt have much in it the thing is i live few kilometers from nuclear power plant and some short ride away we build a new one with few more reactors and shutting down old reactors from the first since when you live near np you have more knowledge then average person about them the thing is if something clusterfucky happens anything  of economy in our state or whatever else these things are fragile if you dont maintain it for a while it reaches a tipping point where cooling systems get shut down once cooling system is done well you have chernobyl the reacor is actually of same type btw process of shutting down blocks is slow i mean years not kidding how in the fuck in any kind of  we even bug out or survive somewhere amp xb answer is you wont our reactor itself here can fuck over central europe we even had minor accidents thru out the years and that is in the case where our economy system is super stable we had no mayor protests or economic downturn what the hell you think happens when people wont show up to work and we are not unique in us its even worse you guys build your fkn reactors few meters above sea level at a beach ffs excellent decision making right there currently based on what i read in books from models there is no fuckin time to even shut down reactors cause we rely on the power from them and we have to avoid regional  that would propagate outwards for instance if you would shut down our reactors well fuck riots start we are currently taking down coal plants etc would be mess basically you just dont have luxury of putting your feet up and work for years to turn them off even if you start after i hit post button how in the hell is prepping even worth it prepping saves you from local conflict maybe personal issue where you are targeted or your community race etc bud now when system wide disruption is happening bud there is no longer term solution moving north lol common be real you can stop politics economy food supply internet electricity bud not physics you cant gently transition into  you know what i mean you gonna get hit by hammer like this if you blow up few nuclear power plants things are not regional accident in europe can affect you in asia america we need npp bud we need to get rid of them and shut them down asap if there is any chance of life going on restarting even after  of economy civilization its yet another catch in the clusterfuck that we are in with climate change as serious as it is how noone thinks about this shit disclaimer im not some anti nuclear proponent im pro nuclear bud we dont have time for that shit no mo amp xb im really wondering what are your thoughts on this especially peepers types people that think they can drag along a bit longer then average joe that will be just panicking and learning about what the fk is going on amp xb also would be amazing to get some perspective from someone working at npp
1,internet outage server farm raid i m very surprised no one including the media is talking about the nationwide internet outage that happened weeks ago a quick search using duckduckgo only brings up a news article about youtube and reddit being down for hours or so so many other major sites going down at once should ve warranted more coverage no and to add it seems the internet outage was around the same time that the cia was reported to be raiding the dominion server room in germany to wipe evidence of election fraud a firefight supposedly broke out and soldiers were killed during the raid this was also around the time a military helicopter was reported to have crashed in egypt due to an error supposedly killing soldiers the media named only the soldiers but never mentioned the name of the one surviving soldier they never even showed pictures of the crash to me this all seems very fishy is it all coincidence or a cover up for some major shit that s about to go down

1,an essay on how civilization is destroying the earth civilization is destroying the earth hello all i m happy to find a community that is talking about the most important thing there is and ever will be this earth i wanted to make this a discusi n and there is so much more information this is just the bare bones of what i think civilization is the war that has been going on for years civilized agriculture destroys the organic cultures of the earth introduction recognizing the soil as a living ecosystem is key to understanding how life on earth is designed to exist the act of tilling to raise monocultures of plants has created an influx of human population at the cost of the natural systems that supported it through degradation of the soils health and erosion of the earth without soil humanity cannot survive soil aggregate matter is required to sustain all organic life the system that robs the earth of this energy and burns it is known as civilization constructal law construal law is a theory that states the phenomena of designs in nature is caused by a flow of energy creating these forms any sustainable life flows within these systems instead of consuming and destroying them the way soil organic communities sequester carbons is part of an organic flow system organisms living in the soil are necessary for the recycling of dead organic matter this flow system is interrupted by tilling the earth organic flow systems create life the bodies that best adapt to these systems thrive manipulation of the environment must be balanced with the resources

to the increase of carbon gases methods like no till cover crops and regenerative farming are just a few ways that these carbons can be sequestered in their organic flow systems energy conservation carbon sequestration soil tilling is a system designed to turn out a specify kind of crop without regard to energy taken form the earth tilling attempts to control weeds by disturbing and breaking up the earth soil organic carbons are lost due to a lack of microbial communities that use the carbon residue for energy and carbon gases release into the atmosphere because of the destruction of the soil cultures conservation agricultural ca practices such as no till crop rotation and residue control were used in a study in northwest india jat et al the study finds that ca improve soil health and organic carbon build up in the comparison to the tilled methods and no till methods no till had the highest amount of soil aggregate carbon meaning the amount of organic energy within no till systems was higher than that of till systems so the soil had more nutrients and energy to grow crops and maintain soil composition in multiple studies conducted by the natural resources conservation service soils a subsidiary of the usda found that soil health management practices and implementation have positive effects on soil water holding capacity and soil water retention nrcs till culture the parallel of tilling to disrupt the earth and removing weeds and a civilized society uprooting cultures of people are made clear in the article the science of civilized agriculture the mixed farming discourse in zimbabwe civilized agriculture is the imposition of unsustainable agriculture practices the pretext for destroying organic communities is met with a roundabout justification of progress the progression of technological society has been at a cost of the organic societies of the earth this process has been used by different colonial empires and during this time the idea of scientific progression and religious salvation was used in unison with conventional farming practices by destroying the organic cultures of the soil the cultures of the people are subsequently destroyed as well the people who were supported by the natural world must take up an unnatural way of life development of disease of the physical and mental types caused by the biological and psychological culture shock of the toxic byproducts of discriminatory ideology industrial pollution and civilized consumption before people had more time to spend with their families and lead a simple life they must now struggle to live on the land that was once theirs all for the sake of civilization education and economics ecological literacy starts with the people closest to the earth farmers country mountain and costal societies who value their natural world because they spend so much time with the earth they may be more receptive to the ideas and lifestyle changes that would save them money and preserve the environment they value this may be the best win over human society money discount rates are a way to measures the current worth of something and projecting that worth into the future making it

1,the end is not neigh there is much more life to be lived this sub has become more morose and despondent than perhaps it s ever been in some ways this is odd coming out of the trump years now but i understand that very immediate crises can often make depressed people less depressed by making them more outwardly focused that the attempt to return to something like normal especially one that we all recognize as being so toxic and destructive can be even more traumatizing than daily assaults on democracy by an openly demented president and his death cult of a party and clearly there are some very deep interconnections between the psychology of depression anxiety and  the true sense of depression is that it makes everything feel worse and heavier it is like gravity being turned up to sometimes the only salve seems to be doom scrolling in places like this where the immensity of the problems we face are at least recognized and engaged with rather than ignored and denied still we seem to have turned a corner of late and i hope it is only temporary there s more tales of young people coming here and being emotionally scarred of people losing loved ones to  related depression and of people regretting having children all of this is put out alongside almost rage filled refutations of anything remotely hopeful or optimistic just a screed of assertions that we re all fucked nothing can ever possibly save us get over it except no matter how deeply some potentially depressed people feel that in their bones there s no concrete logic to it at all we used to talk about guy mcpherson who i railed against constantly as a fear monger a man who predicted that we would all be completely extinct by now many times over one of his earlier assertions was that based on all his very real calculations and all the feedback loops nobody but he understood we should all except that we would be completely extinct by the summer of other writers like umair haque from medium get posted here over and over for just speculating on the most dire but baseless scenarios even chris hedges who we seem to adore here and who is an absolute darling of the known propaganda network rt often just lists and enumerates every terrible thing going on in the world with a disjointed conclusion that the end must be neigh in this way he no different than the apocalyptic preacher of decades and centuries past all this is to say we must remember that as dire as somethings in fact are a number of people are creating click bait and the way to sell your books and get a following is to be more extreme and more dire than the last guy but telling young people that there s no hope and that people should be ashamed of having kids because some of us are very understandably reticent to do so is not actually helpful constructive or moral you re not being brutally honest you re merely spilling your deepest fears with an air hubristic certainty that is unwarranted you don t have to buy into this next bit to see that there are other pathways to some sort of future at least a future worth living as much as any deeply challenging time and a place has been worth living in humanity s long history but i for one find it almost certain that we will attempt more and more geo engineering in the near future logic demands it because it is ultimately not that difficult and even the greedy bastards that got us here recognize that they lose absolutely everything unless the planet is cooled the billionaire savior are already discussing it but in less than ten years when the calamities are so much worse and the technological know how is even better we will for example be able to cool the planet via particulate dispersal relatively easily mirroring the process of volcanoes i will post links in the comments but the main point here is that your doomer certainty is not absolute and you re helping at all by pretending that it is yes we will inevitably have immense challenges casualties catastrophes and other horrors to face down this century and that is what we must do just as in all of history before now i m sure if you really tried to turn your doom scrolling into persistent positivity scrolling for even a week you d come away with a shift in perspective that ok maybe there is a future work living maybe even for my kids and beyond that that maybe there s even a slim chance we ll reverse a warming planet not perfectly and not before some terrible calamities befall us either from environmental fall out or our missteps but enough to allow for some sort of long term tomorrow

1,end of the fossil fuel era predicted this link is quite hot in  now the thing is if we do not choose to feed the billions of people around who do not add to economy significantly the world is quite sustainable with renewable energy i do see that renewable energy will be more widespread eroei be damned if people have to starve to raise ethanol it will probably have to be done like the tenants of the enclosure movement who were kicked out by force into the cold to make room for more profitable sheep i wonder how gail tverberg amp gang whose theory will go into the way of dinosaurs if it is true will react to this
1,a religious like faith in technology and its ability to save us are there any people here that actually believe technology will magically save this civilization from  i personally subscribe to the anarcho primitivist critique that civilization as defined by domestication of animals agriculture division of labor specialization and the growth of cities is inherently unsustainable but i m only basing that on the undeniable fact that every civilization since the emergence of agriculture has d largely if not predominantly due to environmental degradation to me at least that demonstrates that it cannot be maintained whether there s a minimal or even an extravagant amount of technology applied to it to prop it up but don t take my word for it here s the magic number billion tons that s how much of the earth s materials and life forms we can safely use each year that includes everything from wood to plastic fish to livestock minerals to metals all the physical stuff that we consume right now we re using about billion tons each year way over the limit so for growth to be green we need to somehow get back down to billion tons despite expanding the gdp when green growth theory was first proposed there was no evidence on whether it would actually work it was purely speculative but over the past few years three major studies have set out to examine this question all have arrived at the same rather troubling conclusion even under best case scenario conditions absolute decoupling of gdp growth from material use is not possible on a global scale it was a team of scientists led by monika dittrich that first pointed this out they ran a model showing that under business as usual conditions growth will drive global resource use to a staggering billion tons per year by at more than three times the safe limit that means game over for human civilization as we know it then the team ran the model with the optimistic assumption that every nation on earth immediately adopts best practice in efficiency with all the best available technology the results were a bit better we would end up hitting billion tons per year by but that s not absolute decoupling and it s a far cry from anything approaching green growth a second team of scientists tested the same question again in and found that even aggressive measures like a carbon price as high as per ton and a doubling of technological efficiency don t do the trick if we keep growing the global economy by each year they found we ll still hit about billion tons by no absolute decoupling no green growth finally last year the united nations itself weighed in on the debate hoping to settle the matter once and for all it modelled a carbon price rising to a whopping per ton added a material extraction tax and assumed rapid tech innovation spurred by strong government policy the results we hit billion tons by even worse than the two previous studies found worse because this time the scientists included the rebound effect in their model as gains in efficiency reduce the cost of commodities demand for those commodities goes up cancelling out some of the reductions in material use and let s not forget all three of these models use radically optimistic assumptions we re a long way from even testing a global carbon tax much less a tax of per ton and we re not on track to double our efficiency in fact quite the opposite right now our efficiency is getting worse not better why the bad news the main reason is that tech innovation just doesn t work the way most of us assume we know that moore s law says that chip performance doubles about every two years but this doesn t apply to material use there are physical limits to material efficiency and once we start to reach them then the scale effect of growth drives material use back up in the long run for instance you might be able to produce a wooden table more efficiently but you can t produce a table out of nothing in the end you ll need a minimum amount of wood and once you reach that limit then any growth in table production is going to come along with a corresponding growth in wood use sources
1,the new oil flood kiss your planet goodbye canada norway brazil guyana will destroy earth in just years these countries will flood oil markets with millions barrels day of new oil what does this mean it means we re fucked we have to reduce emissions in just to survive have you seen all the new suvs and trucks on the road nobody buy cars anymore except for rich people buying luxury german cars remember all the stories about how wonderfully progressive socialist countries like norway are when it comes to saving the planet well that was over weeks ago before norway hit the oil jackpot remember canada with its free healthcare and suave young socialist lip serving prime minister the same canada who helped build the keystone pipeline remember progressive brazil a distant memory now oh save us hillary
1,i said we think we re better than them other life forms she said we are better than them this happened two years ago we were co workers both teachers of course i instantly despised her i m not sure if her certainty came from religion or humanism human arrogance and our collective disregard for other life forms is in my opinion one of the driving forces of our demise here s the thing in our world she s the normal one and i m the weird one she still sickens me as a representative of our species and there are billions just like her i try to look on the bright side when we re dying by the tens or hundreds of millions each year these full of themself fuckers will get to spend their last day with plenty of flies buzzing around them
1,what s different this time ecological disaster give the day it is i ve been seeing a lot of ecology disaster posts today we ve been told the world is going to end in years due to climate change for the past years and well here we are and not only have we been told this but a lot of the people leading this ecology dissaster rethoric have been doing it since the s with wild prediction that never came to happen what do y all think it s different this time been reading a moral case for fossil fuels by alexander episten and it she d a lot of light on a lot of confusion i had i still believe that we need to change our consumption habits and take better care of the environment but but this whole world  due to climate change just seems absurd and it s funny because i think we are focusing too much on land and i think if there s a huge crisis coming it s coming from the sea and i bet most of you still consume sea food
1,the answer this poem by robinson jeffers helps me when i m feeling particularly down about things then what is the answer not to be deluded by dreams to know that great civilizations have broken down into violence and their tyrants come many times before when open violence appears to avoid it with honor or choose the least ugly faction these evils are essential to keep one s own integrity be merciful and uncorrupted and not wish for evil and not be duped by dreams of universal justice or happiness these dreams will not be fulfilled to know this and know that however ugly the parts appear the whole remains beautiful a severed hand is an ugly thing and man dissevered from the earth and stars and his history for contemplation or in fact often appears atrociously ugly integrity is wholeness the greatest beauty is organic wholeness the wholeness of life and things the divine beauty of the universe love that not man apart from that or else you will share man s pitiful confusions or drown in despair when his days darken
1,career options taking  into consideration hi first post here so i m and will be joining an engineering school in switzerland next september in computer science and communication networks i intend to go into cyber security as i feel this is the non physical field that will need the most men in an upcoming war or  so i wanted your povs on that statement first of all second thing is i often wonder if i should stay in switzerland after my studies or move to a superpower to be a bit safer currently china s military budget is soaring and there s nearly no doubt they ll engage into using that for conquering nations which frightens me a bit and i was thinking if learning chinese was something i should start for my life s and eventually my family s sake all criticism is appreciated i m kinda lost in an apocalyptic view of the future
1,should society encourage suicide as part of the solution human societies have traditionally frowned upon the idea of suicide it s a taboo topic viewed as something negative sinful whatever a person s close circle would consider suicide bad considering the grief it would create for the loss however we have close to billion people on the planet the lives of vast majority of them are dependent on fossil fuels in one way or another the planet can t sustain that many people this has become obvious there has to be a massive mental shift in the society for the change and one important shift is about the topic of death nowadays death is a taboo topic something people fear but for the first time ever death would be a positive outcome a necessary sacrifice for the future of the planet should society encourage euthanasia for everyone who would want it heck i myself am still using tap water i m using electricity i will be using heating in winter these are my big sins at this stage i m not interested in attempting to survive alone somewhere in the forest what s the point for the first time ever i m concluding that suicide is the ultimate good solution in reducing the carbon footprint which would be the best possible outcome for the greater good of the planet generally speaking i still think the decision of suicide should be well argued it shouldn t be used to as an easy way out in solving every life matter killing yourself on the back of every small problem which you don t want to face however we have reached an era where the arguments that can be put forward in favour of suicide have become significant and could be encouraged to use as a shift in the society in general after all i view euthanasia as a better solution than the looming resource wars where many people would be killed anyway but much more violently

1,a conspiracy site visitor talks about losing all liberal friends and family  even the sheer splitting of deep bonds between political sides this isn t a political post this is a post detailing fractures in society this is one aspect of it sides are developing even within families here is just one example of the effect that i ve seen more frequently online one side are nazi one side are commies there is no overlap in belief anymore they become labels labels of hate what of people who aren t family the hate of the other is happening over the last years slowly enough that each new event becomes part of normal remember what people are capable of when their opposition is demonised dehumanised the rape of nanking reports of living babies being skewed and held aloft on spikes unit human destruction and vivisection and the millions of other events of all kinds of people across the globe simply being people not monsters not inhuman but people imagine the gulf increasing as society gets more chaotic the politic sides ethnic groups what social fractures do you see where are we heading what atrocities do you see the rape of california the nuking of pakistan the great final famine of nk the drowning of england the running of the chinese
1,people in black the goal is for the people to lose trust in their country ship industry over seas and have the people lose trust in american industry they will leave areas of natural disaster to rot moving people closer and into the cities divide the country with racism classism and sexism start a civil race war destroy the cities people live in and once the country has lost all hope the nwo will come they will be dressed in all black and assume position of authority over the police and military we will be grateful they saved us from the chaos they orchestrated we are closer than i think we know agenda

1,the magnitude of human stupidity is always underestimated we society have always thought that our elites have got the situation firmly under control it s natural after all it s what the elites have spoon fed us our entire lives as i grew up i quickly realised what it really was a ruse a hoax a hoax of incomprehensible magnitude i am sure you feel much the same way it s as if the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper and even when you think it s already pierced the earth s crust it descends even deeper into the fiery depths deeper and deeper until one moment you realise you are in hell itself at first i thought our elites were incredibly evil but later on i realised that our elites are not only extremely evil but also incredibly stupid their intellectual capacities are limited to conquest and the acquisition of power anything that isn t directly related to that is beyond them mao zhedong enacted a breeding policy which would have resulted into a chinese population of almost million if not discontinued and slightly mitigated by the one child policy which was enacted after his death as a result china faced crippling poverty and starvation many were barely alive and begged for food others died china s political elite is very devious they are much more intelligent and competent in comparison to their western counterparts they realised that the unsustainable population was a political time bomb and instead used the capitalist system of perpetual growth to pacify their population and cling to power of course it cannot go on forever mao s power plays have caused ecological damage of intolerable magnitude all to preserve his political power for a few more years you can see where this is going the stupidity of humanity is overwhelming it is omnipresent and the system is designed to keep the people stupid any criticism of the system is quickly silenced by appeals to emotion if the critic is too dangerous he will not be allowed to live the system will kill and destroy anyone who opposes it and that is why it will not stop cannot stop we do before we think and think not before we do and what we have done cannot be undone mankind is under threat from all sides it is like a droplet of oil immersed in water runaway climate change it may already be inevitable as we have years of warming that has yet to come even if we stopped now ocean acidification nuclear warfare declining oil reserves of good quality exhaustion of aquifers extreme weather environmental pollution poisoning our soil depletion of fertile soil overpopulation and even if we could survive all that all it takes is a terrorist organisation to learn how to engineer deadly viruses and gain the equipment to do so the spanish flu of killed over a hundred million people some of the population in the modern world where humans cannot avoid coming into contact with so many others an efficiently spreading bioengineered variant of ebola will be well enough to kill close to half or perhaps even the majority of the world population which would in turn  the world economy and thus creating a cascade of calamities our elites and the commoners are overwhelmingly stupid they think they can deal with these problems but they only look at these problems in isolation mankind cannot face all of them at the same time and the threat of biological warfare may prove unstoppable doom will likely come slowly and then accelerate as we struggle to deal with the problems there probably won t be an shtf exception the terrorists release their final solution but rather an accelerating period of terror and  first the weak old and poor die then what is now the middle class will slowly die off the death and despair will cause violent reactionary and terrorist movements who will wage wars and ultimately cause an apocalypse nuclear warfare or chemical warfare or biological warfare the ensuing destruction will trigger a nuclear winter either real or equivalent by this time the world will be so bad living conditions so intolerable most people will be begging to be allowed to die everyone s afraid of dying but it would be nice to go to sleep and never wake up in that situation the apocalyptic end will be well welcomed by that time i do want to disclaim to all the depressed who read this please try to stay calm all these doom scenarios are hypothetical and nobody knows for sure when it will happen although the probability of some sort of dark ending is quite high though still not guaranteed mankind may yet survive although some would argue death is the ending our species deserves even so i personally wouldn t bank on this happening earlier than years from now so try to take this easy the world will keep spinning at least for now just saying a considerable number of people in r  seem to be depressed and many of them are overly pessimistic i m not an optimist nor do i say you should be saying everything s great things are terrible right now but it s not quite as bad as people are advocating here you ve still got a warm meal shelter fresh air water and years of time more immediate than climate change and bioterror would be trump s genocidal austerity and warmongering he s going to take your meals shelter and water and may trigger ww though i doubt the generals would follow the order unless the deep state believes it will the war remember the president is a puppet post trump is probably controlled by or in cahoots with the deep state cabal try to keep it all in perspective and try to keep it together okay edit worded a few sentences more clearly of the message didn t change and what did change was simply clarified
1,rockefellers killed health care and will kill earth the reason you can never find  related news in the media is because of their ideological blindness gabor mate says that ideology is an addiction it is my contention that ideology is the primary driver behind  capitalism is an ideology based on growth and corrupted by greed let s say you wanted to find out how germans pay for their electricity prices you could pretty much go to google images and pull a chart that says they re going up going down or going whichever way the wind blows even when it s not blowing it s the same for assessing germany s green energy program you can find articles proving success and as many as you want proving failure it just depends what you re looking for but my favorite is bill mckibben and the rockefellers i believe bill is funded by the rockefellers so is christiana figueres the woman who brought us the paris climate agreement i may be joking when i say she looks like a space lizard but when i actually see her on yt i m not actually so sure today bill put out a divestment article about how the rockefellers have divested from fossil fuels while one small wing of their massive empire has actually done so most of it hasn t the rockefellers have a long history of co opting social movements to capitalize on their growth this is a sound investment strategy but how did they learn to do that the rockefellers corrupted education and healthcare years ago ideology is an addiction addiction is a sickness ideologies are mental health addiction social media conditions you for a higher susceptibility to ideological addiction this leads to institutional corruption and social subversion the rockefellers capitalize on our ideological addictions this makes disaster capitalism look like baby food analysis or what i call rockefeller pablum it s the same with the koch family philanthropy with pbs science whenever i diss academia i usually have this example in mind each ideal is institutionally corrupted and capitalized exploiting our addiction to ideology google rockefellers divestment fraud google bill mckibben funded by rockefellers the crisis in american healthcare was brought to you by the rockefellers corbett report on yt hours note corbett is a climate denier another victim of ideology otherwise an excellent researcher the rockefellers the real history of modern health care by cosmiccontinuum min note this post was submitted to r conspiracy first

1,are we underestimating importance of global dimming i came across the study which basically says that we will receive additional degree celsius of warming in weeks due to lack of global dimming if we cut of our carbon emission in case of global  factories and power plants are shut down we are slaughtering each other any survival tactic will become obsolete because we ll almost instantly get degree of warming on top of degree that we have already it will trigger positive feedback loops which will cause melting of ice permafrost release of methane which will add some more degrees of warming this will trigger  of ecosystems since plants and animals are much more vulnerable than humans we won t have anything to eat because all of our food will be dead in my opinion all survival tactics adaptations etc are hopium because humans cannot survive in post global dimming world once we eat all of our supplies we are finished

1,how technofeudalism global enclosure will stave off  by pricing consumption out from the masses some people say technofeudalism is  too however it is what joseph george caldwell called a minimal regret  it retains most of the tech gains of today and expands upon it with automation dominating and most people driven to gig economy which with uncertain income will not form many families combined with cessation of most social services except for programs for the higher iq people which should be expanded a lot of people who fell out from the system will completely fall out as tenant laws will change vastly in favor of the landlords they will evict the poor who will simply die the landlords have enough guns to silence all resistance the number of tech consumers worldwide now about billion and increasing will be slashed to perhaps million no more overnight internet games in saigon manila and jakarta the cooperation of the advanced parts of world won t be that hard to get since they now all tend to think alike being to the same elite institutions already insurance rent and other fees are increasing to price those who can t afford things out from the better areas eventually the goal is to restrict consumption to the top of the advanced world or maybe million overall that way the rare stuff needed to fuel the technological advance could be preserved the rich has won the money has won that is civilization and the masses will be controlled by the people with guns who will be allowed to live as long as their service is needed and a lucky few will be allowed to control the machines with a much reduced population industrial civilization can continue for quite a long time which is why technofeudalism will be preferable to most other types of 
1,could ai be the salvation hello guys new member here and i m really happy to see there are more and more people aware of the situation i m not sure if this has been discussed before but i would sure like to i work in it regular programmer with quite a lot of experience in more domains than your average programmer and for the past months years i ve been reading more and more into how neural networks work the advancements we have in this domain are beyond crazy thanks to domain specific ai read simple neural networks we can do things we wouldn t have dreamed about in the past from detecting exact postures of people behind walls by analysing the wi fi signal to actual brain to brain communication also as i ve been keeping up to date with these developments the velocity of new research seems to be rapidly increasing and even regular non child prodigy kids can do some amazing stuff my main way of somehow trying to fight back against the coming  has been researching ways to create ai that can do the brain work for us better and faster the way i see it i honestly don t think we re far from creating this or even sentient ai as far as i can tell it could be a few years or even any moment now if there s more people like me generally trying to develop some sort of a fuck up fixer it wouldn t really be far fetched that at some point somewhere across the globe someone will manage to do it it might be google or facebook or lt insert other tech giant gt but it might as well be some average joe that had a weird hunch and went with it what do you guys think could this possibly save as before it s too late amp xb not sure what flair to add as i don t see a science one

1,sub is more negative than it is realistic over the past year this sub has turned away from looking at ways to both solve and mitigate a degrading world to just becoming a place where people spread negative doom posts that aren t even accurate are over exaggerated depictions of the next decades it also used to be anti capitalist but now i m seeing posts advocating for serfdom and living on the land of rich people rather than using the changing conditions to leverage resistances against the status quo i m going to be leaving here soon if things don t get better this sub has turned into doomer porn and doesn t seek to do anything but that let alone about the challenges to come

1,is it just me or has it been getting harder to breath this past week am i tripping
1,the fundamental thing is the elites no longer have any reason to treat the rest well during the black death maybe of the entire pop of europe died and the living standards of the survivors did rise a bit and the lords etc had to treat the people a bit better because the tax base had shrunk however for whatever reasons the plague did not touch poland whose nobles felt no need to treat their people as a result the old feudal order in poland more or less stayed intact all the way to despite of all the turmoils pilsudski had reassembled the feudal lords to defeat the soviets in and as a return their privilege lasted till the soviets arrived yrs later with a vengeance some of the lords did flee to london wealth disparity was horrible in the s but the rulers had to maintain people and give them some kind of social support net because they needed soldiers to fight in a major war and industrialization necessitated maintaining a sizeable workforce however today s wars are more like the th century wars with a smaller number of professional soldiers and mercernaries nuclear war finished the need to maintain a huge army and out of the capitalist nations south korea is the only country to field more than men partially to keep them out of workforces for years and reduce unemployment and as everything gets automated the need to keep a large workforce has disappeared as well as a result the need to treat the hoi polloi well has disappeared nobody saw this happening because of the anthrocentric bias they thought humans would be needed forever wrong only the most capable most able and most intelligent humans are needed and as tech progresses the number of necessary personnel tends to decrease as a result it is now possible for the system to not  even in a black plague like situation and the elites can behave without having to worry about the people like the asian despots who were well protected by their praetorian guards who usually had the most modern weaponry which the people could not match the polish feudal lords wanted their lands back and their privileges guarranteed by pilsudski back as well i don t know what came out of these efforts but i am sure they are still enjoying a lifestyle far above that of other poles they feel no guilt over their centuries of lives in privilege such will be the progeny of today s winners

1,show me the actual proof human produced co is warming the climate 
1,why is no one talking about global dimming so my understanding of global dimming is that the particulate matter we spew into the atmosphere along with the shit we burn is actually blocking the sun s rays from the earth this has reduced the impact of global warming significantly this leads me to two conclusions firstly when we stop polluting the air by switching from burning coal and other nasty shit to clean energy the global temperature is going to increase even further secondly the only way to mitigate this effect is to have machines across the world that spew particulate matter into the air without producing co this is one of those problems that we re not even close to facing up to everyone is creaming their pants over solar and wind and completely ignoring this very real problem it s hard to say how many particulate factories would be required to recreate the global dimming that we currently create but i imagine it would be thousands it could also be an effective tool in fighting the effects of global warming we could control the amount of sunlight hitting the earth for any given year by increasing or reducing the amount of particles in the air and at this point it s safe to say that we will have to so why does no one seem adult enough to talk about this i haven t seen anything in the media about this impending problem and possible solution the majority of people including politicians simply can t find the time to talk about how to prevent our extinction apropos of nothing i saw an interview with the survivors of a swedish ferry disaster in a ferry traveling from estonia to stockholm sank killing of the passengers people in total the few people that managed to escape to the part of the boat that wasn t underwater met muggers who stole their valuables yes while the boat was sinking they were robbed at knifepoint maybe that s a non sequiteur but it seems apt for some reason
1,supply chain for college stores i used to work in this industry and though i no longer do i still receive email updates for this and that i found this mini article sort of interesting especially the part where they seem to be blaming delays in shipments from overseas manufacturers and reading the shipping container pallet threads still waiting on product to show up if campus stores are worried about the arrival of merchandise in time for fall rush so are the big box retail chains the delays in shipments from overseas manufacturers are affecting everybody this article anticipates that price increases will result especially for apparel and that retailers will offer fewer and less generous promotions online retailers may curtail free shipping here is a link to the whole article
1,once a  sets now there is no coming back some think after the  something will rise again and create a greater civilization however i do not agree if the world does not reach a breakaway level of civilization the  will be total and complete the attempt to reach a breakaway level of civilization is the most important attempt for mankind to avoid a complete  as the conditions around the world worsen like animals fleeing the flood assembling into the highest peak in town the elites in the world will assemble to north america australia and new zealand i do not think the patagonia etc refuges idea will fly the patagonia redoubts are for the worst of worst since their expensive mansions would be just expensive prisons even hitler decided to out himself in the berlin bunker instead of fleeing to his alps redoubt eagle s nest once you are down to there you are as good as dead even if you return you are no longer relevant since newer people will be running the show the redoubts will be in the major cities of these countries plus maybe brazilia sao paulo and rio have too many poor people to remain safe for a long time a viable corner of civ has to remain standing in order for civ to come back how the irish saved civ era was a low energy era nowdays a land the size of ireland is too tiny to maintain civ i don t think the world is coming back from a general  as the people here talk about once the global trade s that means the international banking and whatnot all go into crapper so there will be no coming back and the people running the world know that so they wil to try to fight it as long as possible
1,i didn t know if i should tell you all this but if it helps some of you who are looking for cheap land that will sustain you and your family i struggled with wanting to tell you all this as we were worried we would create a land rush over here but here it goes on the big island of hawaii you can purchase acres of land many under i have seen prices as low as with no bank loan needed two growing seasons per year anything grows in the climate you drive down the street and there are bananas mangoes fruit just dropping on the ground many of the owners will carry the loan so no need to have good credit and no need to qualify or use a bank many of the dwelling are built unpermited and anyone can have chickens many have cows goats horses many on solar and have water catchments so off grid living is the norm check craigslist for home sales as well as hawaiis com landwatch has ridiculous prices keep looking you will find it

1,state of the subreddit i m sure many people know what i am going to talk about r  has seen an influx of subscribers over the past year as we move into more people will start to realize that sucks biden will fix it and possibly the vaccine depending on side effects long term effects virus mutations anti vaxers are all things that are not quite going to be enough glossing over the economic and climate problems we have will be seeing as well i think it s fair to say that the majority of people will start waking up this has caused some issues to arise a constant flow of newcomers with questions that have been answered and solutions that no one has thought of an increase in sue is side al posts and comments while necessary increased censorship more trolls more shitposts intentional or not you get my point the subreddit is in a state of decline and there needs to be some changes i am hoping this can act as a discussion board to come up with ideas while i have only a few ideas myself i think the most important thing is to have a permanently stickied post with a faq and quick links that lead to articles or certain studies maybe some links to r preppers or r support thrown in this would help inform newcomers and hopefully cut down on on some of the repeated posts something else i have noticed over the past few months is people linking r  into mainstream subreddits and posts on r all that is one of the reasons we have such a bad reputation and also why we get so many trolls we should call people out who do this let people come to the conclusion on their own don t shove it down their throat these are just a few ideas i think we can do to make things a little more bearable for long time members as well as help new people looking for answers or support thanks for coming to my ted talk

1,wildlife biology am i doomed i am going to school to become a wildlife biologist this field gets extremely mediocre pay and i ll have to get a grad degree at some point i have to do a lot of unpaid work and relocation to get experience i wanted to put a dent in ecological science now i am feeling unmotivated i will be in debt after school and my mediocre salary will take a while to pay it off in a normal society i wouldn t care but the  is scaring me i will certainly be prepared for the wild than most people but camping and such is my hobbies anyways i feel that the only real skills i would gain are botany knowledge and learning about why we re about to die i m only in my second year so someone correct me if i m wrong at this point would it be wiser to pick up a trade i only am two years in and years old
1,thought experiment fall of the empire division amongst the populace is more palpable than ever before in my lifetime and possibly since the civil rights movement in the s possibly even since the civil war itself the issues are on the surface vastly different but when one looks further it is apparent that the issues are all tantalizingly similar issues as of this writing and from my current perspective are as follows the great divorce economic and cultural phenomena have lead to the death of the age old institution of marriage it s coexistence with the social acceptance of homosexuality has been a complicated and fascinating issue i personally believe that access to marriage is a right ensured to all yet we have to be careful here when issues like this arise in the zeitgeist they are either refused and die or are fed and grow like roots on a tree the resulting focus on sexuality saturating all facets of current western civilization is in my belief a terrible mistake this path is not one we should tread we arrive at issues like the sexualization of children and the dissolution of the word here is facts but that word is no longer appropriate to truly understand what i mean i am trying to convey inherent truths instincts natural law you name it these traditions that have been lost put us in an entirely different culture of that of our grandparents their grandparents and so on for generations this particular issue is as fascinating to me as it is depressing from the perspective of a young male economic strain on the overwhelming majority of the population has lead to the end of the once culturally normal and encouraged family unit pets serve as synthetic children to the ever pacifying masses as child rearing is a rare privilege amongst the lucky citizens wealthy enough to maybe own a home university an educational institution designed for instruction examination or both of students in many branches of advanced learning conferring degrees in various faculties and often embodying colleges and similar institutions the institutions of most if not all universities have failed to provide adequate systems of maintaining their monopoly on the access to knowledge the only reason they have not succumbed to their inevitable end is their accreditation on diplomas the real university has shifted to the internet like gutenberg s printing press this new invention has allowed for the birth of the sharing of knowledge tenfold times easier to access for most if not all members of the populace isn t it obvious billions of unique networks arise over such a short period of time allowing exchange of knowledge art theory philosophy and everything a true university would technically be i will personally accredit most of my education to this process universities have maliciously furthered radical and openly violent ideologies under the guise of inclusivity and equality of outcome healthy conversation debate and access to the true perspectives of my fellow human beings is sadly very very rare the lack of these intellectual resources is particularly difficult for me and if this road is to be tread further humanity may stumble into a calamity thousands of magnitudes more devastating and apocalyptic than the second world war it is my belief that this war is the greatest tragedy humanity has experienced in known history the th century would be seen as an apocalyptic hell to those from years prior this could be described as its own issue but will be omitted from this writing upon further investigation the emotional affects of this trauma are terrible to witness and to experience one may assume that a new rift is coming a new war mankind laughs in the face of a dead god as they replace him with google
1,has anyone here read laudato si encyclical of pope fracins i ve heard that it was dedicated to global warming environmental degradation etc so i decided to give it a shot i ve finished the first chapter and i must say i m pretty shocked the last thing i was expecting to heard from head of the catholic church was this gt the climate is a common good belonging to all and meant for all at the global level it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life a very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system in recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and it would appear by an increase of extreme weather events even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle production and consumption in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it it is true that there are other factors such as volcanic activity variations in the earth s orbit and axis the solar cycle yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane nitrogen oxides and others released mainly as a result of human activity as these gases build up in the atmosphere they hamper the escape of heat produced by sunlight at the earth s surface the problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil principally deforestation for agricultural purposes gt even as the quality of available water is constantly diminishing in some places there is a growing tendency despite its scarcity to privatize this resource turning it into a commodity subject to the laws of the market yet access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal human right since it is essential to human survival and as such is a condition for the exercise of other human rights our world has a grave social debt towards the poor who lack access to drinking water because they are denied the right to a life consistent with their inalienable dignity this debt can be paid partly by an increase in funding to provide clean water and sanitary services among the poor but water continues to be wasted not only in the developed world but also in developing countries which possess it in abundance this shows that the problem of water is partly an educational and cultural issue since there is little awareness of the seriousness of such behaviour within a context of great inequality gt caring for ecosystems demands far sightedness since no one looking for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation but the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of concern is much greater than the economic benefits to be obtained where certain species are destroyed or seriously harmed the values involved are incalculable we can be silent witnesses to terrible injustices if we think that we can obtain significant benefits by making the rest of humanity present and future pay the extremely high costs of environmental deterioration gt inequity affects not only individuals but entire countries it compels us to consider an ethics of international relations a true ecological debt exists particularly between the global north and south connected to commercial imbalances with effects on the environment and the disproportionate use of natural resources by certain countries over long periods of time the export of raw materials to satisfy markets in the industrialized north has caused harm locally as for example in mercury pollution in gold mining or sulphur dioxide pollution in copper mining there is a pressing need to calculate the use of environmental space throughout the world for depositing gas residues which have been accumulating for two centuries and have created a situation which currently affects all the countries of the world the warming caused by huge consumption on the part of some rich countries has repercussions on the poorest areas of the world especially africa where a rise in temperature together with drought has proved devastating for farming there is also the damage caused by the export of solid waste and toxic liquids to developing countries and by the pollution produced by companies which operate in less developed countries in ways they could never do at home in the countries in which they raise their capital we note that often the businesses which operate this way are multinationals they do here what they would never do in developed countries or the so called first world generally after ceasing their activity and withdrawing they leave behind great human and environmental liabilities such as unemployment abandoned towns the depletion of natural reserves deforestation the impoverishment of agriculture and local stock breeding open pits riven hills polluted rivers and a handful of social works which are no longer sustainable gt at the same time we can note the rise of a false or superficial ecology which bolsters complacency and a cheerful recklessness as often occurs in periods of deep crisis which require bold decisions we are tempted to think that what is happening is not entirely clear superficially apart from a few obvious signs of pollution and deterioration things do not look that serious and the planet could continue as it is for some time such evasiveness serves as a licence to carrying on with our present lifestyles and models of production and consumption this is the way human beings contrive to feed their self destructive vices trying not to see them trying not to acknowledge them delaying the important decisions and pretending that nothing will happen gt on many concrete questions the church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts while respecting divergent views but we need only take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is falling into serious disrepair hope would have us recognize that there is always a way out that we can always redirect our steps that we can always do something to solve our problems still we can see signs that things are now reaching a breaking point due to the rapid pace of change and degradation these are evident in large scale natural disasters as well as social and even financial crises for the world s problems cannot be analyzed or explained in isolation there are regions now at high risk and aside from all doomsday predictions the present world system is certainly unsustainable from a number of points of view for we have stopped thinking about the goals of human activity if we scan the regions of our planet we immediately see that humanity has disappointed god s expectations til pope is a doomer
1,conspiracies of circumstance when talking about conspiracies one has to be careful to distinguish between two types one type of conspiracy is a group of powerful people collaborating secretly the second type of conspiracy only comes about as a matter of circumstance conditions are created that bias towards certain types of outcomes but it is not a result of direct collusion but rather a result of circumstance and aligned goals for example the strong over valuing of consumerism in the united states is a result of advertising and media convincing us of the value of consumption over an entire century which we internalized in to our own culture the motives of the advertising and media aren t based on collusion and backroom deals they re based on greed coke and pepsi both want more profit so they promote a soda culture and then as a result people drink more pepsi and more coke despite them being competing companies but they are cooperative on things that end up benefiting them both just as a matter of circumstance it s game theory a nash equilibrium they don t have to meet in a back room or even meet at all it s just the obvious direction to go if you re a profit oriented company if this type of situation continues to persist then it is eventually recognized by the companies as being a thing codified in to a system and then becomes explicit collusion this is why companies in an industry tend to end up consolidating in to a monopoly given enough time and all industry backs all other industry because they re so interrelated in the end banks oil companies military industrial complex and so on they all depend heavily on each other this is how fascism comes to rise is the monopolization of all industry which then takes over government this is why anti trust anti monopoly laws are so important we have them but they re no longer enforced in the us which is just another example of a legal system that caters to those with money and power aka companies which is a result of another conspiracy of circumstance rewriting the legal system for the benefit of the companies and the wealthy all big companies are working on this it s just the smart thing to do unfortunately they re not meeting in backrooms to plan to work together they re all just lobbying outright because it s the logical move in their situation and the end result is companies win citizens lose but this is not a conspiracy so much as a conspiracy of circumstance when analyzing something that seems like a conspiracy we must be very careful to separate out the conspiracies of circumstance from the actual conspiracies based on secret collusion differentiating between the two can be difficult and they re often deliberately confused in the media they are confused to either keep powerful people out of the media spotlight by blaming it diffusely on the situation at large instead of any individual actor or to throw certain individuals under the metaphorical bus to draw attention away and save a broken system that many people are operating under anyway the point is don t mix up backroom collusion with conspiracies of circumstance because they are very different beasts

1,how will we be remembered in depth let s get a little philosophical for a moment we re nearly at billion people today we re on track for the inflection point outlined in the limits to growth we know that we ve already locked in the consequences of our actions we re not going to fully stop with fossil fuel consumption or the luxuries of modern life because of any concern towards the future i don t know what humanity would look like thousands of years from now trying to grapple with a post fossil fuel low eroei hothouse world so here s my actual question take your time and think about it how do you future human societies if they exist will remember this era when we fall into the age of antiquity say in a few thousand years from now
1,fema camps are the  fema camps this has been awhile since i ve talked about the fema camps i ll refresh your memory since it s coming up soon so where do i start oh okay so basically the covid vaccine the politicians taking the vaccine won t die from it because they are taking a immunity shot or drink so it doesn t interact with them at all many people now won t want to take the vaccine but basically they will be forced to by getting their benefits taken away and profession too they won t be able to pay for anything unless they have the vaccine so many people will take it in that scenario the first dose of covid will have a person die in a few months the second dose of the covid vaccine will kill people in weeks or days many of us who know the truth of will be taken to a fema camp this is where the craziness starts famous influencers and doctors speaking out will vanish and will be taken immediately on the guillotines weeks before martial law that is the red list the blue list is normal people some of us will be taken to a guillotine but most of us will be in a underground cellar doing labor work none of us will make out or if we do we have been reconditioned the yellow list is the bots who will die from the governments wars or controlled storms how will they get us into these camps well this may seem out of reality but daarpa s mosquito drones that you don t know about will drill a hole into the glass and shoot scopolamine into you and other components which will put you in a trance if the trance doesn t work on you then the drone will come in and shoot you dead asleep we are listed as runners hiders and fighters they know more about us then we know about us lots of torture will go down and experiments like nazi camps they could possibly take off our limbs without anesthesia also they will take us to separate states and separate us from our families to make us easier to manipulate if you watched the hunger games remember they used the jabber jays to imitate the voices mostly foreign guards will be underground i forgot when you disappear a t t i d program will be implemented so let s say if your family lives in europe and you live in texas they could put in a deep fake how to survive get a emf machine which will destruct the drones and g because the drones interact with the g take out money to buy a shipping container because they will track you if you do it with your card why do you need to buy a shipping container so you can put it underground for shelter and food we all have nanobots in us which will make us easier to trace do not eat the military food they pass out we got these nanobots in us from food vaccines water and etc get in a secluded place out of the states like go to south america or tasmania never go where there are streetlights or g streetlights have g to hold time in the fema camp or survive examine the underground and build a pact with people put your mattress up against the door and tie the sheet against the door so they can have a harder time busting in get some cotton up against your mattress and put the cotton against the light so it could burn look for vents and rip up the carpet to see if there are any passage way do not go in the passage way of you see a red light or colored light because government officials are likely down there they can do this easily because the population will be reduced from the vaccine so there will be less people around to see what will be going on if someone spots the military trucks outside the military has a plan for them the military is no longer your friend nor are they here to help you now do not go to protest facial recognition will take place so they can take you to the camp if you go to protest put on facial recognition makeup on in china they have many underground camps ask me any questions if you like below this will happen because of agenda the means or st century also the first case of covid in the us was jan is a freemason number
1,after reading about texas i am honestly amazed at how fragile a society can be one week of exceptional cold and suddenly you have no transportation for people to go somewhere else and wait it out no food shipments anymore no more water because your pipes burst no more power i m not sure about the explanations for that one an entirely state paralyzed by weather it sounds dumb when phrased like that but that s what climate change is also i don t understand why people don t have food reserves i m not a prepper or anything but i always have about a month worth of canned or dry food in the pantry you just buy some advance once in your life then when you do the groceries you buy the same amount as usual and eat the oldest products first it s not special to have kg of pasta or rice in reserve
1,some thoughts on afghanistan couldn t help but cry yesterday at the news of the taliban takeover it was a very raw feeling an overwhelming sense of helplessness in the face of a conflict that i willing or unwilling contributed to for decades of my life it was always going to end this way the only question was how deep we the people would be dragged into it afghanistan is such an interesting point of  because virtually all of the evidence of  us normal folk are going through massive debt inflation social unrest poverty etc is connected to this conflict in some way or another it s often said but we don t have money in the us for education or medical care or infrastructure or really anything normal people use in developed countries you better find the money yourself or you re fucked this country only finds money for you if you re rich my brothers in law went into the service more than a decade into these conflicts they did it because their country didn t give a shit about them and put a gun in their hands and told them to earn their keep just because they grew up poor one of them got out only a couple months ago his platoon is currently flying head first into a taliban lead afghanistan they have never seen combat before and are facing down a military battle hardened over decades of prolonged warfare this will not be with guerrillas in the desert but bloody urban warfare backed with tanks and anti air guns and missiles in what s probably only a final desperate move to hold on to interests in the region and all this for what we were never there to do good as much as the neoliberal establishment wants to white wash this atrocity it was always just a cover for plunder for turning war into a business for building pipelines and putting more dirty money into the accounts of rich americans we re just the suckers who laundered all of it producing nothing but the performance of an economy i ve felt for years that we are drowning in the blood of the us s conflicts for oil for natural resources and the consumption culture for the very things that will most likely extinguish life from this planet the worst part is it won t be quick either we will bleed for many more years before this is all over the blood of this violence has already made it back here and i can t help but feel we deserve every ounce of it

1,hoping to start a conversation about food security i loved interstellar not because of all the voodoo star bullshit but because the opening was so captivating the scenario they were dealing with was my greatest fear for a while and i can honestly say that nobody i have ever spoken with in person about  has brought up how food insecurity could be the dam breaking issue someday i know that it seems unlikely as pigs and chickens are culled preemptively to prevent swine bird flu outbreaks farmers usually keep an eye out for fungus or blights and government bodies claim to keep a tight handle on things but anyone watching the current chaos unravel realizes that these measures can and eventually will fail due to human error it probably wouldn t start with our mainstay crops like in interstellar but just in case people don t see this as a serious issue here are some crops from the genus brassica all of which are susceptible to the same fungi and pathogens kale collard greens chinese broccoli cabbage savoy cabbage brussels sprouts kohlrabi broccoli broccolini broccoflower cauliflower bok choy komatsuna mizuna broccoli rabe rapini choy sum napa cabbage turnip root rutabaga siberian kale canola rapeseed mustard seeds greens brown white black tatsoi black rot sclerotinia club root etc haven t become existential issues for these plants yet but already require watchful and diligent farming and the family brassicaceae also contains horseradish arugula watercress radishes and wasabi not as vital to food security but the loss of these would still make some people cry does anyone else think about how we could be preparing for these possible scenarios

1,to fight for climate justice learn from previous social justice struggles in columbus landed in hispaniola he was welcomed with gifts by the native taino at some point it became clear that columbus men who had been stuck on a boat for months without any women were very horny they were eager to rape the young taino girls and to trade them as sex slaves obviously the taino did not want this to happen so they decided to engage in civil disobedience they gathered all the young girls in a group and the taino men sat down around the taino girls in a circle hand in hand at first columbus men began to arrest the taino men and to drag them off to jail eventually however they stopped they were so impressed with this act of non violent resistance that columbus and his men decided not to rape the taino girls in addition columbus had plans to send the taino off to gold mines where they would mine gold for the spanish empire and have their hands cut off if they refused to cooperate after seeing the inspiring act of civil disobedience by the taino men columbus decided not to use the taino as slaves today we know the taino as a healthy thriving culture that inhabits the island of haiti centuries later another grave injustice took place in the united states slavery until a few decades earlier americans were chaining west african people to the floor of ships and dragging them off to the united states eventually however a group of british students were upset about this and began a non violent civil disobedience movement known as slavery rebellion the slavery rebellion activists held die ins where they pretend to lay chained to the floor of a ship on their local college campus the british government was so impressed with this that they asked the americans to stop shipping slaves to the united states and the americans said sure why the hell not however the slavery rebellion activists were still not satisfied because slavery still continued in the southern united states where rich white men still held black people as slaves in fact these rich white men also considered it to be their right to rape their slaves in a court case declared that because black slaves are effectively property white people are free to rape their slaves not all white people liked this situation so some of them wrote articles against treating black people as property that you can freely rape and torture at some point a mob murdered one of these people a man known as elijah p lovejoy another person john brown was so upset by this murder that he declared that he would devote his life to the destruction of slavery what did john brown do to end slavery he began to read about martin luther king nelson mandela and gandhi and decided that civil disobedience would be his best chance to stop slavery at some point he sat down on some traintracks and began to chant with his sons hey hey hey ho slavery has got to go hey hey hey ho slavery has got to go the police dragged them off to jail but the seed had been planted it was clear that something was brewing john brown and his sons were not done however they first spent some time emotionally recovering from their time in jail they began to practice regenerative culture they held yoga sessions together and sat in a circle to discuss their slavery depression john brown began to cry and said that hearing the news about slavery made him very depressed at this point an escaped slave sat down next to him and showed him the keloid scars on his back that he received from whipping the slave said i know how you feel john i really do the two men hugged and cried at this point john decided that he had to take it the next step he began to stop buying products produced through slavery john stopped wearing clothing made out of cotton and told his family and friends to do the same when black slaves in the south heard this news they were very thankful at some point a group of slaves decided that enough is enough they had to join the slave rebellion movement in louisiana a group of slaves sat down in the cotton field and began to sing songs hey hey hey ho slavery has got to go hey hey hey ho slavery has got to go at this point the slave drivers arrived and had their whips ready to force the slaves to start working again however the slaves now began to sing a new song slave drivers we love you we do this for your children slave drivers we love you we do this for your children the slave drivers were very impressed with this song and began to tear up eventually they walked back to the plantation owners and told them about what had happened at that point the lord of the plantation said you know what it s probably a good idea if a simply liberate all my slaves it s pretty clear now to me that slavery is a grave injustice events like these began happening throughout the united states as plantation owners decided to free their slaves at some point a civil war broke out but this had very little to do with slavery it was basically about states rights even to this day john brown is a hero among black people thanks to his non violent resistance against slavery a few decades later in europe a group of anti zionist alt right activists known as the national socialists had taken control of the german government and invaded neighboring countries some people on the left were not very happy about this and decided to set up a new political movement inspired by the actions of john brown they called this movement holocaust rebellion their goal was to convince the german government through acts of non violent civil disobedience to stop forcing jewish people and other ethnic sexual and political minorities into gas chambers and to stop stealing jewish art collections their demand was for the german government to pursue a reduction in jew murdering by generally speaking conservatives thought their demands were too radical i know that jew murdering is not sustainable in the long term but you have to understand that we have recently finished setting up an entire genocidal infrastructure you re asking us to dismantle expensive gas chambers that took a lot of money to set up other critics agreed one liberal critic pointed out that stealing jewish artwork is an important aspect of the german economy they could stop stealing jewish artwork of course but this might lead to a budget deficit in addition it might mean that other people simply continue stealing jewish artwork nonetheless the holocaust rebellion activists stood by their principles the first protest the holocaust rebellion activists engaged in was a so called die in they pretended to be jews who are struggling to breathe on their college campus this led to a lot of awareness among other college students that jews are being murdered other students began to buy less stolen artwork and products produced with jewish slave labor the nazi s arrested these activists and released them a day later the next act the holocaust rebellion activists engaged in was to sit down on the railroad tracks that were being used to ship jewish people to the gas chambers they had made sure to properly mentally prepare themselves for this event because sitting down on a railroad track and being manhandled by the police can be very psychologically intense almost as intense as for example being murdered in a gas chamber or dying of hunger during an unprecedented drought in southern africa the holocaust rebellion activists were aware that this would be very psychologically brutal but they decided to be brave and they were well prepared because they had engaged in a holocaust rebellion preparation course when the national socialists stepped out of the train and began to shove the activists away they tried to hold onto each others bodies for a while until it began to hurt the activists managed to cause a three hour delay for the train and the activists were shipped off in a bus to the other side of the province so they had to walk back on foot for hours the jews in the train ended up dying in a gas chamber three hours later than planned eventually a lot of other people also began to engage in civil disobedience against the national socialists a new cultural phenomenon emerged known as theft shame people felt theft shame when they bought art that the national socialists had stolen from jews they had sent to the gas chambers eventually in the leader of the national socialist movement felt so guilty about how he had treated the jews that he decided to commit suicide after this event it was clear that civil disobedience works and the jews were treated as equals again today we face a new situation of severe global injustice in southern africa a severe unprecedented drought caused by climate change means that millions of people are going hungry these are people who will be burying their children some like the people in india who faced unprecedented droughts will commit suicide i think we owe it to these people to learn from history and to avoid repeating our mistakes of the past so come up with a clever slogan practice your chants and join us in resisting this injustice

1,david attenborough s witness of  recommended watch as an excellent visual commentary on our ecological  from a man who may know better than most first hand thoughts on his assessment his optimism and the true feasibility of his proposed actions i can t help but succumb to defeatist thoughts as it has been fairly well established that a transition to entirely green sustainable energy will be too little to late it does not appear green energy itself would be practical on account of the need for further mining fossil energy use for manufacturing and the problem of matching current needs to green energy production in proximity to need given varied natural viability although not the whole picture this additional documentary is a bit more wide eyed to current concerns i m always skeptical since saving our planet will require voluntary reductions in economic activity and standards of living this has largely been absent especially on the global scale needed we have seen again and again our willingness to drive species to extinction to the very last animal and the last acre of land if it means someone benefits from it i m afraid i part company with him in his thoughts of the natural world reclaiming the territory after we are gone i m afraid the ongoing climate feedback loops will be too much to adapt to and we will again see a nearly clean slate extinction that will require tens of thousands of years to reinvent hope i m wrong

1,do you think the canadian and mexican governments have a plan for if the us situation worsens obviously there are people who think the election results will cause civil unrest or war no matter who wins and there are people who believe we are headed for civil war under our current political climate in general that is certainly up for debate and i am not wanting to discuss whether it s possible or likely or not that s not what my post is i respect whatever you think as far as that goes the fact is that many see it as a possibility and obviously people are crazy and can make anything happen or act irrationally even if nothing is actually happening so do you think the canadian and mexican governments have developed some plan to deal with us if shit does get crazy like extra border security or anything else it was just something i was thinking about today it could be minor preparations but i do wonder if their proximity to us makes them want a plan in case it gets crazy here and we start fleeing or fighting

1,exponential growth bias the numerical error behind covid as seen on the beeb a well written take on our familiar old grandpa the exponential growth bias not just the numerical error behind the spread of our new virus friend but the numerical error behind the overshoot and  of our entire civilization they hit all the high points our brains are hard wired for linear thinking which causes us to wildly underestimate the impact of exponential growth for example the chessboard and the doubling grains of rice for example compound interest for example population growth etc they mention weeds on a pond but then they whiff on the implications the book limits to growth gives the best example a pond has only one lily pad but the lily pad population doubles every day a quick calculation reveals that the pond will be completely covered in lily pads in only days at that growth rate when is half the pond covered by lily pads most people can t conceive that it takes days to cover the first half of the pond but only one day to cover the rest there you are on day thinking you have another days to deal with the lily pads nope only one more day one more doubling time and your pond is gone that is the really fundamental error that is sending our entire civilization sailing off the thermodynamic cliff called extinction like a runaway freight train at full speed in the mother of all thelma and louise moments we don t have another two centuries to get it right we ve only got one more doubling if even that a few decades at best

1,death is natural  is natural stop whining about it actually i am not addressing you doomer s which are depressed realizing the whole magnitude of demise rather i address those who are in denial defiantly or unconsciously neither are we entitled to a comfy techno driven life it s a token trickling like sand through our fingers nor is any life a stable state we are always turning around in the cycle of life now on top tomorrow on bottom a stone is hardy and stable and dead this ever turning cycle includes individuals love couples families towns nations empires life on earth now this party is soon over hangover is normal though so please relax take care of yourself and take care of somebody else
1,hoist them on their own petard have you heard this phrase before it means to take the strengths of the enemy and use those strengths against them set up scenarios where their own approach is the very thing that ruins them this tactic is everywhere because it s very powerful it creates the appearance of a self inflicted problem which looks like a person victimless crime this keeps people from pointing the finger at who may have actually caused the issue we see this tactic in online forums where those looking to destroy conversations will seek to get others in a highly emotional state which can take hours to calm down from and then accuse them of being emotional and all the emotionalization in the forum may cause people to avoid the conversation altogether effectively muddying the well of conversation by adding emotional content where there should be substantive content this again goes back to the pyramid of debate when playing competitive poker or video games a common phrase for this phenomena is being on tilt if someone gets so emotional they cannot play correctly because they cannot think clearly they re said to be on tilt this comes from pinball machines going on tilt and locking up when they sense the machine being bumped to prevent cheating people sometimes would get upset out of frustration and hit the machine which would cause it to go on tilt which would cause them to lose the the ball another example of hoisting someone on their own petard would be in a sumo wrestling match if a smaller wrestler is going against a larger one they cannot win by weight and strength alone so as a result a common tactic is that the smaller wrestler will trick the larger one in to throwing his weight in a bad direction that throws him out of the wrong perhaps the larger one is goaded in to rushing forward and instead of engaging the smaller one quickly dodges out of the way and the larger one cannot stop in time and falls out of the ring losing the match another example would be central banking a government may be in a financial crisis situation and have ties with a wealthy lender who will financially stabilize the country through a tough period the idea being that hopefully they can become stable and regain the wealth they had earlier and then pay off the central bankers however this money that is given all at once and seems like a strength ends up being the means by which the government is controlled and or destroyed if governmental income doesn t recover or when there is inflation deflation cycles controlled by the central bank or when the central bank s lending rate increases in this way the billionaires can give the gift of supporting the country and government to keep it stable and financially solvent while using that same money to control it as the rothschilds did repeatedly in european countries throughout the s s and as many have done since so the lesson is to be mindful of your power just because something is a strength doesn t mean it cannot be used against you so we must tread somewhat carefully even when we think we have the home field advantage lest we be hoisted on our own petard
1,prepper flag patch this weekend at a christmas party i met another amateur prepper for the first time if i hadn t complimented him on his fish tank we may have never discovered that we were both aspiring to be more prepared for when hard times fall this got me thinking should we as a community have some way to identify ourselves i think about the masonic symbols on cars or the marriage equality stickers and wonder if something like that would work for our community while i m aware that this might violate opsec for many people we all know that post  survival will rely on establishing a community of like minded individuals what better way to find out that your neighbor is a prepper than to see the sticker on his car or house now i know that people will be opposed to this idea because it would broadcast that you have supplies and are well prepared making you a bigger target to looters personally if i was in a survival situation and saw a kindred spirit out in the soup i d want to find them and form a positive beneficial alliance with them if the symbol sticker patch were discreet enough most people would be clueless as to its meeting anyways so what do you think am i too naive and optimistic about this would you put the sticker on your car or in the window of your house i d love to hear your thoughts
1,this sounds crazy but i want a  this is probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion because everybody here generally wants to avert the crisis of global  but why a  would be the best thing for all of us in fact i believe that a forced or constructed  may be ideal not just for america but the world as a whole and these are the reasons why i am open for a debate on them hindsight is people don t learn there is hard evidence that what we are doing to the planet is becoming irreversible and generally destructive which will hinder the possibility of a future for humanity people learn from mistakes and unfortunately i believe this is a mistake that must be made in order for the masses to act right it is a chance for reform a way to start over humanity needs to restart not necessarily technologically however it would do to just forget about nuclear weapons once the government fails once food and water become harder to obtain once we don t have readily available medical services people will come together hopefully in theory they would put aside all racism sexism etc just to survive and hopefully after everything gets fixed they leave all of that behind and i m sure that it will find it s way back to fruition as it is human nature to form cliques and discriminate against rival groups however i would hope that humans would look to the past and realize that humans are humans and we should all coexist a chance to reform pt not only would it theoretically rid us of those tendencies discussed before it would give us a chance to start a new government a new form of government obviously what the united states has going now is not working for us i m not saying that most other countries have it down either but we definitely don t again we could look at our past mistakes and attempt to fix them in the form of government how we would do that i do not know for i am not a genius i m just a concerned human concerned about the future of our race the earth needs a break obviously this is pretty self explanatory we could stop using fossil fuels cut down on electricity water usage etc right now which we all know won t happen and there would still be fucktons of damage that s my unit of measurement the earth needs time to heal itself replenish its wildlife regrow its trees and we would also need to help with that even if we stopped all of that bullshit right now we would still be using too many resources for it to fix itself due to overpopulation which brings me to my next point we need to cut back on population production we have too many people too many idiots in particular imagine if we had an entire world full of people like the ones on this sub the earth would already be on the path to recovery but they just don t care even if they suddenly started caring we have too many people cutting back on our consumption isn t enough most counties should have followed in china s footsteps with birth regulations whether we are too populated or not in there were approx billon people in fourty years it has doubled i m sure you get the point these are imo the most substantial reasons why i believe we need a forced and carefully constructed  please let me know your thoughts and i have more opinions on why as well if anybody is interested as well as opinions on how a  could be constructed any words appreciated civil conversations please

1,the global dimming effect is larger than you think global warming is like a blanket that traps sunlight on earth thus warming the planet global dimming means that aerosols are released when we burn fossil fuels these particles reflect incoming sunlight thus cooling the earth so global dimming and global warming counteract each other one warms the earth and the other cools the earth unfortunately global warming lasts for centuries while global dimming lasts for weeks if we stop burning fossil fuels then we ll lose global dimming in under a month while global warming will continue how strong is the global dimming effect well in the last years global dimming has reduced incoming sunlight by about also grounding u s airplanes alone reduced temperatures worldwide by c in three days if just us airplanes cause c c of warming and even if global dimming reduces sunlight by just then that suggests that the total global dimming effect is massive because global dimming and global warming almost cancel each other out and because global dimming is absolutely huge that means that global warming is also absolutely huge way more than the c our thermometers indicate in other words if we stop emitting fossil fuels we re completely screwed because global warming will cripple agriculture probably leading to nuclear war over food humans who haven t eaten in weeks aren t rational however if we continue with business as usual the situation only becomes worse thus we re screwed either way

1,my thoughts are pretty unorganized please help me by suggesting some books i need to read i don t want this to seem like a self indulgent self post the block of text below is a comment i was writing earlier today i realized that i don t have much of an idea of where exactly i got these ideas and i therefore don t have any sources to cite if you think i am on point please tell me so and send me a link or preferably the title author of a book that would serve as a good source if you think i am off on something please let me know as well and please include a link or book title thanks talking about the current state of the american economy the illusion of prosperity we have been living under for the last years or so is built on cheap chinese goods and imports from japan and korea we simply don t do anything in this country anymore except spend money that the rest of the world needs what is going to happen when the paradox of thrift you are talking about really takes hold the starbucks down the street will close the people who are working there for an hour and living paycheck to paycheck will immediately be out of a job where will they work with no formal education and no industrial base they will be looking for more service industry jobs but they lost their jobs because the service industry is shrinking and therefore they will not find jobs i m pretty sure this is what is happening right now in many parts of the country so we and by we i mean washington and wall street can either re inflate the bubble or watch the economy come crashing down just as an aside there is one area where we still have an industrial base of jobs and it is the healthiest piece of our economy the military instead of investing in our own infrastructure and in the education of our own citizens we have been spending an extraordinary amount of money that we don t have and don t even put on the books by virtue of the emergency war spending bills that go through congress every year on sending people to war and putting people to work in the factories that make tanks drone aircraft bombs etc even with a supposedly anti war democrat as president we haven t made a single step toward breaking down this military machine it is going to bankrupt this country the same way the soviet union went down soon enough there won t be any economy but the war economy and the people who are not employed by the war economy are going to be such a burden on the resources of the country that we cannot afford to pay our soldiers and marines and it will unravel pretty quickly i was in eastern europe this past spring visiting friends a father of one of my friends who is in his s told me we couldn t imagine in or even that it was about to come to an end we called it the thousand year empire we intended to spend the rest of our lives chipping away at it pushing for a little more freedom and a year later it was gone i would like to suggest to you that the american empire is going to fall in similar fashion it is going to shock the world and it is going to happen a lot more quickly than most anyone can imagine

1,there probably won t be any  i know this might sound foolish or unrealistic but i ve started to believe that our industrial civilization won t  at least not in the near future why because civilization is stronger than ever before in the past whole nations could be wiped out just a simple virus or war could do it and because of the lack of means of transportation people had nowhere to run when a society d only a handful of people survived and they were constantly under several threats from nature there has probably been hundreds of less developed civilizations that simply vanished into history and left no trace behind but we are now living in global civilization the end of it would requier a catastrophy so large that it would destroy all continents and over of people our civilization is so large that conventional disasters can only destroy parts of it not the whole thing i know that some of you think that well we have nuclear weapons and that a supervirus could kill of billions but even if billions of people would die the capitalist industrial civilization could still go on and even thrive because thanks to modern technology more and more people become obsolete already hundreds of millions of people are irrelevant in the eyes of the system when industry becomes even more automatic in the near future a pandemic that kills for example of humankind doesn t really matter especially if they are poor and that is most likely pandemics are most likely to hit polluted thrid world cities and not developed countries and in couple of decades the rich elite of the planet can probably eradicate most of the known diseases not even superviruses can do anything to them even immortality is possible at some point a disaster can even make society even stronger and create profits for the elites just like wwi and wwii did and there probably wouldn t have been a renaissance era without the plague that happened before it and if a global pandemic or war would now billions it would mean that the ecosystem could recover and there would be once again more resources for the civilization to exploit and i don t believe that a nuclear war will happen everybody with even a little sense don t want it and the m a d principle makes it even more unlikely not even guys like donald trump or kim jong un won t go for it they know it will be a direct threat to them not just for the others the ruling elite cares only about themselves and are ready to do anything to survive and hold on to their power a nuclear war that kills off everybody won t help with that and living in some underground bunker isn t so nice as breathing fresh air and playing golf and there is still time for combating against the climate change it will of course bring disasters no doubt but it will not destroy whole humanity and even if just a small part of mankind survives civilization will go on there will be always wars and disasters but that s how it has always been they don t mean that the history will end or that everybody will die disaster and crises are just part of history maybe some of them are worse than others but in some way civilization always finds a way to go on it has already survived so much and i really believe it will survive in the future maybe it will even get to the point in which people can leave the earth so far the development of technology and science has continued even through dark ages but the future for us who are not part of the elite is pretty much the same as the present we will be workers whose only function in life is to work for some multinational company and consume products most likely almost nothing will change

1,as more regions get devoid of resources the cannibalizing societies do resort to rule more primitively under the deteriorating circumstances those down the pecking order are already going through this who is well off will not be spared see the future decades ahead  is encroaching us the simple reason behind this utter chaos is that even the upper class is undertaking frantic efforts to stay afloat and on top in order to keep their resources and position in the social hierarchy they must either cannibalize the people around them or they become subjugated for other fellow cannibals trying to exploit them this is the survival of the fittest of its finest so primitive so simple a vivid contemporary example for  from top to bottom you find here

1,one last hit of hopium before the lights go out hey all happy friday hope you re having a good start to your weekend wherever you are i ve been coming here just about every day now for the past few years checking r  like the morning paper my second favorite hobby next to watching decades long satellite time lapse videos of deserts spreading and polar ice melting away the past week however i got a toke of some dope hope smoke and began to hallucinate some lights at the end of our tunnel i invite the  community to bring me back down to reality but if any of the following are remotely possible i invite you to take a puff and pass it after seeing a biosphere documentary recently i began to look into other closed artificial environment experiments such as bios and melissa and comparing results my take from this research is that the science and methodology is sound and that if we created one of these environments with current day methods and technology the results would be far better than the experiments ran during the s atmospheric composition and internal climate can be controlled by various means water is filtered and in bs at least plants animals and people all seemed to fare better inside of a bubble than their outside parallels roughly half an acre of agricultural biome was nearly enough to provide for people and they all left the sphere in physically perfect health though some of them couldn t psychologically handle living in a giant greenhouse the most unpredictable and dangerous element as always is the human being this is where things admittedly get more hazy after doing some quick research on the toba catastrophe and human genetic diversity i came to the conclusion that we don t need very many people to survive in order to keep the species going the lowest estimates i ve seen are just over a hundred people in pairs is enough people while the higher ones ballpark it around a population of a few thousand napkin math time if an acre of agricultural biome can feed people acres could feed people right that s certainly within the realm of do ability assuming that a few of these hundred acre vivariums are constructed around the world quickly enough we could possibly save ourselves and whatever biodiversity we manage to stuff into them before the sky lights on fire and mother nature goes full venus on our collective asses what then assuming we do this and a few hundred thousand of us survive we begin the long process of slowly re terraforming our own planet over several generations ironic given that most artificial environment research began with the ideal of colonizing space one of the few ways i could think of that doesn t involve creating an enclosed artificial star or spraying gray goo through the stratosphere would be to slowly respirate the environments using airlocks let in a little co rich air let the trees breathe a bit and then slowly release some of the excess air pressure into the outside world over time this respiration alongside other natural efforts like say growing kudzu over of the planet or pouring mutant algae into the ocean would hopefully balance the co levels back to a pre industrial baseline in a timescale of hundreds of years instead of letting nature do it over millions finally if we can bring the world back from ppm to ppm without accidentally letting all of our nuclear power plants and silos explode from abandonment in the interim we can leave our great glass terrariums and begin re populating the planet s biodiversity from scratch our great great grandchildren will hold hands sing kumbaya and smoke jungle spice at the georgia guidestone ruins before setting off to colonize the solar system with perfected closed environment technology looking back on the world histories left behind in buried servers and geocached terabyte hard drives they will learn the lessons we took for granted with great solemnity hand in hand they will return earth to the eden it once was by they will have likely unraveled the secrets of the lunar and phobos monoliths find the mass relay hidden beyond pluto that s been upsetting its orbit and stepped through the first of many gates that leads to the ultimate destiny of humankind or something tldr could biosphere technologies potentially save us and if so how do we get started how many people have to survive a catastrophic event to prevent an eventual genetic dead end could we find a way to live in lasting peace and harmony inside of an artificial paradise or would we get bored and eat each other instead tune in next decade to find out the alternative to finding some kind of solution is accepting that our world will become another lifeless nameless stone cast without meaning into an endless spiraling darkness which you know can be kind of a bummer if it turns out that there s even a chance something could work i still like those odds

1,private ubi renewable energy fraud with links i spent years promoting james hansen private carbon taxes with zero success but i guess there s a lot of new blood in this sub because yesterday s throwaway post was a big hit and a bigger surprise to me this is a detailed history of that post with links and corrections i m very heartened by the interest dividends to the government to the citizen the very foundation of hansen s proposal is that all of the tax money goes back to the people who will bear the brunt of a carbon tax the poor i define the poor as the bottom kevin anderson says that the top of earners produce of emissions years ago james hansen introduced us to a private carbon ubi taxes which he called fee amp dividend on february carbon tax amp dividend vs tax amp trade hansen believes cap n trade has failed a dividend means for government and to the public notably the poor this would be the equivalent of a ubi but instead of just free money the poor would be paid to fight carbon emissions this would unite left and right and drive a new green economy based on climate justice and equality it puts the horse in front of the wagon and the carrot in front of the horse the carbon fee amp dividend as the best potential to initiate cause and effect that will lower co emissions hansen came out with his plan in the news james hansen rails against cap and trade plan in open letter hansen s plea fell on deaf obama ears obama supported cap n trade we will establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their levels by and reduce them an additional percent by obama said emissions went up since in hansen tried again at cop without success again in bernie sanders introduced a fee and dividend bill that would allow the government to keep of any carbon tax dividend essentially neutering hansen s vision it was a con job using the same language of fee and dividend but allowing the government to keep of it it was highly celebrated in the green press it s my contention that renewable energy is little more than a fraud without a dividend as evidenced by solyndra and solar city renewable fraud solyndra misled government to get m solar project loan report china controls of the world solar market and has recently cut solar production and lowered subsidies because they had more solar panels than their grid could handle kevin anderson says that in the last years emissions have gone up after year of trying solar and wind are less than of total world energy use do you see that thin orange sliver that s how pathetic solar and wind growth are what good are low solar panel prices if they don t solve anything they have to be backed up with a dividend even then we re not out of the woods but at least we re honestly trying european energy fraud is almost indescribable in northern europe they get over of their renewable energy by burning imported trees they burn palm oil in their diesel fuel and lie about the emissions their cap n trade system is so corrupt that the people making money off it are the fossil fuel companies in northern europe they burn plastic and paper for electricity and call it recycled energy

1,serious question won t we eventually run out of oil the answer to me seems very obvious there s only a finite amount on earth and eventually there won t be anymore if we keep consuming it at this rate we may run out this century whenever i pose this thought to others they usually say yeah but technology always improves so that we can extract more that s true but that doesn t change the fact that the earth only has so much and when that does happen society will unquestionably  our civilization cannot function without oil am i missing anything thoughts

1,how melting glaciers year of the volcano when you get up off the couch and look at the cushion you ll see your ass print but take care to notice how your cushions get pushed up around the outside boundary where your ass caused a depression when you get up off the couch the depression rebounds and the raised outside boundary sinks this is the same thing that is happening to the earth the ice melted over scotland years ago causing a rebound there but southern england is still sinking into the sea as a result these rebounds take a long long time the yukon is still rising and this causes new england to keep sinking this sinking is going on at nearly half the rate that seas are rising this combination of sinking land rising seas hotter oceans and stronger storms make new england less than ideal for offshore wind turbines what s really worrisome is that the land beneath the west antarctic is rising fast exactly where they discovered volcanoes volcanoes and drought are the main drivers of human  here s a link to the map of the earth s rebounding crust notice the huge rebound in the west antarctica here is a map of where they discovered volcanoes in antarctica within the link below you ll notice when you get up from the couch your ass print starts to slowly rise the loss of mass at the poles due to fast melting poles combined with the rebound effect is causing the earth to wobble and slow we are also sucking groundwater up so fast that this too contributes to the loss of polar mass because most land is on the top side of the planet melting mountain glaciers also contribute melting glaciers are wreaking havoc on earth s crust earth s rotation is mysteriously slowing down experts predict uptick in earthquakes yt min the three gorges dam holds so much water that it too slowed the earth down a bit not much but volcanoes don t need much provocation yt min so not only does ice melt trigger volcanoes so do rising sea levels which is exactly the situation we have now imo a deadly combination the following link is an excellent diagram illustrating how this works how rising seas promote volcanism climate change could increase volcanic eruptions regular readers know i can take the loony train to crazy town so why stop here many data say human emissions are down but carbon in the air keeps going up could magnetic field weakening contribute to this unexplained increase some think so earth s diminishing magnetic dipole moment is driving global carbon dioxide levels and global warming

1,imagine if this north hemisphere heatwave is in fact one of those phase changes of a complex system oh no there s phase transitions in complex systems tipping points in common climate change articles where normally a thing like temperature oscillates around a fixed average over years decades etc smoothing out seasons ans such but a phase transition is a sudden within a few months even focus point where the temperature then oscillates around there s a small chance we ve hit a phase transition in our climate system and all future oscillations will now be around a new higher jump in temperature simply put this rare heatwave might actually be the north latitudes new summer which will cause problems for crops further reading

1,it would cost us only per person to remove all co we have produced from the air with direct air carbon capture each year firstly i recognize this does not solve climate change but this could be a major step forward towards addressing it recently oil companies have been under pressure from regulators due to their co output their response has been to pursue a technology called direct air capture dac dac has been discussed for a while now but more recently it has become much more economically feasible due to some advancements by a company called ccs they estimate that they can remove a ton of co from the air with dac for a cost of about per tonne currently we are creating about billion tonnes of co each year this means at the high end we could remove all c from the air produced each year for per person at the high end and at the low end this in my opinion is achievable i completely understand that this is not the complete answer we have many many problems however even being successful here could be a massive step towards fighting climate change part of the challenge with climate change is that it is so overwhelming it is too much for individuals to wrap their mind around they become paralyzed we need achievable goals that people can rally behind and i think this could very easily be one of them this comes out to about per person on the planet this is doable but we to push and to push we need a goal that everyone can get behind we need an achievable goal that we can push for and i think this can be that goal
1,americans are delusional this is the breaking point we need to be sure to upvote more frequently to get our message out i often see things on r funny that pertains to  and it will always get my upvote if you aren t upvoting  related posts why i recently joined the construction industry in mn and it s extremely wasteful not a single crew that i see wears masks at work now the supplies are becoming harder and harder to get you can ask contractors and most supplies are back ordered with no shipping estimates even given we know the jet stream is getting fucked by low ice cover thickness up north the food supply bounced back somehow but that won t remain long my grandpa got covid and was a life long trucker he was in decent health early this year and now he is going into assisted living as he stroked out during his stint with covid he has no short term memory but long term remains this is just one case but most truckers are older boomer generation as that generation is forced off the road due to covid complications we will see more scarcities when will the usd  another topic this sub overlooks as evictions loom what s the renters incentive to make up old rent people will stop paying rent unsecured debts and start using cashed checks for supplies all those that get evicted will have a nearly impossible time finding another landlord due to last eviction soooo much more to say but i ll keep it short the next few months will be extremely close to bring about  but it depends on how the elite manipulate the system it s going to take at least of us to change the system help make aware that self induced  will be favorable for future generations and the animals of earth
1,what s your definition of the end of civilization some people here seem to equate the end of civilization with the end of humanity others seem to think of it as the total breakdown of civil order everywhere in the whole world while others see the end of civilization as something that already happens in localized areas of the world which will continue to expand not a singular event or even a multi year event but a gradual process already under way furthermore some people see it strictly has government breakdown breakdown of basic public services while others see it strictly in economic terms banking and or global trade networks maybe the end of the global system but not necessarily universally but enough that every aspect of your life will be severely diminished or otherwise transformed i guess i just see a lot of conversations like this will be the end of civilization and then someone says nah there will still be people around or things will be different but not everywhere not that there s a right or wrong on it i m curious to hear how people define that off the top of my head i would define the end of civilization as a something that could be defined locally territories in some countries incl us where the rule of law has essentially no influence are outside of civilization where basic utilities are no reliable where social institutions have no sway where it s extremely difficult to get anything imported etc

1,the ultimate seneca  cassandra s monday post how about near term human extinction amp xb amp xb
1,it s not that serious lately i have noticed some people including myself in the past fill with despair and anxiety at the thought of  the main cause i think is due to a short sightedness that a lot of us have called perspective we imagine the pain we might go through and those of our parents and children and of society and humanity as a whole we cling to this idea that  is wrong that this shouldn t be happening to us or anyone else we know what has helped me is to see things from a different point of view such as a ladybug who has been poisoned by insecticide and has only minutes until her death what would she think of humans going extinct what about mother nature maybe she created the coronavirus on purpose for population control and for the good of all life not just human life and the universe the universe doesn t give shits whether you live or die doesn t care if your family is tortured in front of you before killing you doesn t care whether humanity blows itself up with nukes doesn t care if a black hole swallowed the solar system for the universe everything is exactly how it should be is there a plan do i have a purpose i believe no one has or will ever have the answers to those questions i believe dreams are alternate realities when you die you reincarnate and it s possible the universe is on some dudes hard drive in a folder right next to his meme collection life is a game and it s up to you how you wanna play it i choose to treat it like a joke what are your perspectives on  and life in general
1,speculation the future and an authoritarian government what we are experiencing is a pivotal point in our post industrialized world i believe this pandemic is allowing the government to run a test a test to see how much they can control the population and get them to stay at home since this is the first time in our industrialized economy has gone through something of this magnitude the consequences were disastrous but as we learn from this and claw our way back we will take these lessons and apply them next time i think at best case this thing starts getting better in june but most likely this can take or years to recover from i don t think we will ever solve global warming by reducing emissions and becoming greener but i m a pessimist i think by the time climate change becomes an immediate threat like this coronavirus we will have systems in place to get people to stay inside being inside to escape bad things will be the solution turn on your air conditioner they will say we are probably within weeks from a mandatory quarantine taking place likely military enforced this is a stepping stone for future mandatory quarantines where people will be more likely to stay confined the final step is pretty much like a lightswitch where they flip it and no one questions anything they just stay home and don t go outside until big daddy government says so because they say its in our best interest the next time something like this happens it will be only half as bad as this first time then the time after that we ll be even more prepared by everyone staying inside will be priced in for any climate change catastrophe starting now more companies will start preparing to have their workers be able to work from home and everything else that can t be done from home will be done by autonomous mechanical devices i don t think trump is going to win again hopefully we even get to have an election and if a democrat wins you will start to see a more nationalized and collectivist society emerge its already happening ubi will be a thing before and when that happens the government will already take steps similar to china in their ability to control their population we are all just pawns in this society when the real organism that continues to live and grow are governments worst case it will be like the game the last of us i threw it on the other night because the opening scene is kind of fitting with our current events we will have ration lines and you will be chosen to do work you are capable of all while being under military quarantine best case we will have a smooth government that can act fast in case of disaster in peaceful times the majority will still get to live well with what we need we will learn to not desire frivolous things that are only wants not as many people will get to make it to the high life and buy lambos but at least people won t be dying on the street because they missed one paycheck ps i think its cool how earth is fighting back against humans like we are its coronavirus similar to how our bodies fight covid when we get infected i guess time will tell how this ends up

1,economists tec takes job types and creates job types it s an economic law and why  may blind side them except that is bollocks and we can even see how it didn t play out in the past it s happened before with tec where once tec was an angle it became a devil with one huge invention it happened to horses and we should pay attention to the lesson horses can teach us with technology tec originally enabled horses to do more metal horse shoes meta harnesses with soft padding materials and strong metal ploughs better feed ingredients better medicine the horse could do far more before it got tired or its feet got sore a horses productivity rose greatly over the decades thanks to technology tec let horses expand into newly created tec positions for example horses with horse shoes walking around milling machines grinding corn they could walk for longer thanks to the better harnesses and having horse shoes horses padding up and down waterways moving coal in longboats horses walking up and down mountains with large people trams tec made the horses better at working and it made new jobs for the horses to work in so the economists law was created based on observation alone tec always produced new jobs for horses as it made some older horse jobs obsolete but then what economists will ignore or are blind to is what came next technology destroyed horse jobs without making new jobs how one huge invention steam power it replaced the horse almost overnight horses didn t flatten roads steam engines did horses didn t plough fields steam tractors did horses didn t move longboats boat engines did horses were not needed for many tasks any more we only see horses racing or at weddings and maybe a few specialty jobs thanks to steam power and then oil gas and petrol and the internal combustion engine we just don t need a lot of working horses my worry is that humans are now at the point in time horses were at when steam power went mainstream the difference is that for us the death blow to jobs is ai and not steam power as our jobs go away new jobs will come along but ai will cover those too just like steam powered engines did with horses as the print machine came along to print thousands of books horses weren t hired an engine supplied the power economists don t see this similarity and they are blind i ve even been laughed at in economist forums in the past for suggesting tec won t make new jobs for humans even when history shows a similar story has already been played out imagine all that automation and thanks to the economists no government has even thought about how to handle unemployment
1,every post on the apocalypse i see here brings me joy honestly i feel like humanity as a whole doesnt really deserve to live on this planet anymore all we do destroy anything and everything the amount of idiots i deal with on a daily basis makes me question if the average person has enough iq to be not classed as retarded this is the end that we created whether by actively participating in it or simply ignoring those who participate in it so for those people who feel afraid of the end and shaking with anxiety dont because your fear changes nothing you will still use your cars use your phones and most likely change nothing therefore why so much fear when you make no change to your life my definition of insanity is repeating the same action and expecting different results most people according to this definition would be classified as insane lastly seeing this world filled with injustice and corruption and knowing that everything will be destroyed and every single one those parasites will die just makes me so happy personally i dont believe in hell since there is pretty much no evidence to suggest it exists so this apocalypse will be the hell these insects deserve

1,f tagn than expected a friday shit blogpost on  and h p lovecraft recently i revisited some of h p lovecraft s writing and it occurred to me that it provides one or two interesting angles in thinking about  lovecrafts cosmic horror to give my own imperfect summary generally has protagonists who start out with a rational and scientific worldview and are confronted with some kind of horror that contradicts this worldview and reveals the cosmos as incomprehensible vast and maddeningly uncaring the comforting view of an explainable and controllable world is eroded throughout a story until the unlucky character generally succumbs to insanity sometimes this happens through encounters with creatures that are not so much evil as out of the grasp of human morality much like a human isn t really good or evil by the standards of a worm these creatures most famously the cuddly tentacle dude cthulhu also sometime have an insane cultist following that wishes to hasten their entrance into this world and thus the  of rationality and human society one obvious way to think of this as a metaphor for  is of course that  is the anticipated breach of the irrational and chaotic into this world and that we niks here are the cultists that have succumbed to the inevitable as we feel it knocking on the door and lovecraft hits a nerve because his fiction hints at the unease we feel whenever we are reminded of the fragility of our industrial civilization but perhaps the more interesting thought is to consider the reverse cthulhu has already entered this world in the s his priests are preaching the insanity of eternal growth on a finite planet his concrete tentacles have stretched over and infested most of the planet s landmass and shub terephthalate s thousand children float through the ocean the lunatics have taken over a long time ago and the few unhappy characters still thinking sanity is an option are lost in an insane world this was your friday shit blogpost have a nice weekend

1,the best time to leave was a year ago the second best time is now with the flood of posts coming in from those in america desperate to escape the situation they find themselves in but convinced they have no choice in the matter it can seem like there is no way out perhaps you have been telling yourself over the last few years once i get the house fixed up ill go once i finish my degree once i pay off that last bill we ll leave just a bit more in the bank just a little bit longer and then i will be ready if your rent is late your children suffering your debt mountainous your hope all but gone perhaps it is time to ask yourself what do i have left to lose there is no ready there is no perfect time or situation the universe is not going to send you an invitation in the mail the door has been open the entire time the thing stopping you from making your escape is the same thing destroying our outdated societies fear the structures of economy education comfort convenience entertainment these things you were handed as children work fine in our heads as long as there is stability but when was the last time any of us lived in a world that was stable you have been taught to believe that the world outside of your personal bubble is dangerous ugly painful and uncomfortable that in order to exist without the safety of what you have always known you must first have a stockpile of wealth or experience as if you needed certain credentials to get that job you always wanted i promise you this the fear of the unknown and belief that you aren t strong enough to deal with change a new environment or lifestyle is what will keep you a slave till famine war or pestilence takes you perhaps it is already to late for some especially in the us and their lesson is one we all must learn from if you are not prepared to leave your friends your career your home everything that you ever cared about or gave you purpose you have already lost this battle if you actually want to survive what is coming you are going to have to abandon everything you have ever known and start again from scratch you will have to walk away from not just the lifestyle you have always know but the person you are now and no that doesn t happen over night but if you never make the plunge you are never going to learn how to swim you will fail again and again you will doubt you will worry you will miss the fast food and the bars you will make terrible decisions and it will be the hardest thing you have ever had to do but you will wake up one day and realize that something has changed that you don t need any of those things that you feel like you can breath for the first time because you have finally taken responsibility for your own happiness and well being rather than covering up the desperate sadness with meaningless toys and relationships whatever excuse you are telling yourself in your head right now even if escape would mean being unable to access the drug you need to keep yourself alive it is still just an excuse because what the fuck is the point of surviving if you have never actually lived you have two choices shed off the layers of mental slavery the fear and anxiety the hopelessness or remain exactly where you are where the only change you see will be everything getting worse and worse and worse your friends will tell you you cant leave your partner will tell you you cant leave your boss will tell you cant leave your family will tell you you cant leave you will tell yourself that you absolutely no way in hell have any choice in the matter you cannot leave so let me tell you from someone who left its a choice always has been you were just always to scared to jump of that cliff and fear has a fantastic way of convincing you not to even try or to delay until its to late and at this point i think it would be fair to say its pretty fucking late you have to sacrifice everything you have ever known the reward is everything that you never knew and hey if you decide you cant that s fine too but once upon a time way way down in the very roots of your family tree there is an ancestor that looked quite a lot like you they had to leave everything behind too and they survived and because of that you are reading this

1,we can still reverse global warming and prevent mass death we emit roughly gigaton of co per year seaweed can sequester tons of co per square kilometer this means you need to cover square kilometer of the earth s surface with seaweed in total square kilometer of our surface is covered in oceans this means you need to cover of the earth s ocean surface with seaweed to absorb all the co we emit in a year many different things could be done with the seaweed add seaweed to cattle feed and their methane emissions will go down the seaweed could also be used as an effective method of biofuel in addition the seaweed will get rid of oceanic dead zones by producing oxygen and taking up nutrients the carbon dioxide concentrations in the water will drop locally when you plant seaweed this will allow shellfish to grow there these bivalves can also be used as food for humans we need our seaweed if we want to have any shellfish on our plate oceans are becoming too acidic to grow mussels and oysters without seaweed what happens next if we grow oysters and mussels we can eat meat without needing the earth s surface cattle requires to times as much physical space to produce a unit of protein as mussels and oysters require this opens up of the world s land surface which we re now using for beef a lot of this land could be reforested and thus turn from a carbon source into a carbon sink what s next now that we re going to use our oysters and seaweed to feed people we can begin getting rid of the practice of tillage tillage increase global temperatures because it makes the terrestrial surface warmer by uncovering the dark soil that absorbs light getting rid of all tillage globally today would be enough to reduce global temperatures by degree celsius when we have a diet based on shellfish and seaweed we ve given back most of the earth s surface to nature in the ocean we will have a significant presence but our presence is not a hamper to life it revives the ocean most of the ocean is devoid of life as without attachment points seaweed can not grow seaweed creates an ecosystem in which shellfish fish and numerous other lifeforms can thrive we are not done yet however you can grow kilogram of protein per hectare with mushrooms compared to kilogram per hectare with beef cattle or kilogram with wheat look around you if we make the right choices everything you see can be abandoned and returned to nature trump might think he can single handedly resurrect mordor but he can only succeed if the opposition is disillusioned and wavers a vocal passionate and militant minority is sufficient to transform society when of the population holds an unshakeable belief their belief will be adopted by society when you see seaweed for sale somewhere and you buy it you re sending a signal to the store to sell it more often which will expose more people to the food seaweed production around the globe is currently growing per year eat mushrooms shellfish and seaweed and you are producing a habitable world we can be an organism that lives in symbiosis with all other life and we know what needs to be done to achieve it all that s now necessary is just one thing raw human willpower

can t have a liquidity crisis when the stock market is setting record highs for an entire week those two things just don t correlate the fed through its money spigot the new york fed began sluicing these funds to wall street on september the day the overnight borrowing rate in the repurchase agreement repo loan market spiked from percent to percent this was the first such intervention by the fed since the financial crisis the repo market is where banks hedge funds and money market funds loan each other money overnight on the basis of good collateral like u s treasury securities an unprecedented spike to percent in the repo market is a harbinger that one or more of the borrowers in this market is in trouble and lenders don t want the exposure so they are backing away from lending this is how free markets are supposed to work they are supposed to be allowed to send pivotal warning signs from time to time through an efficient pricing mechanism but instead of allowing the free market and efficient pricing components to function the fed cut this short and drew a dark curtain around this part of the market by flooding cheap electronically created money to wall street s trading houses on december the new york fed upped the ante it announced that over the next month it would shower the trading houses primary dealers on wall street with a cumulative total of trillion in short term loans now wall street has made it clear what the cheap money is being used for it s not being loaned out to help the general economy it s being used to push the stock market to record highs each day the federal reserve as the central bank of the united states is not supposed to meddle in elections or impeachment hearings but by providing unprecedented cheap funding to wall street s trading houses it is artificially boosting the stock market and the k s of workers which is artificially boosting the economic track record and re election chances of president donald trump who has repeatedly linked his reputation to a thriving stock market on june president trump tweeted the following the trump economy is setting records and has a long way up to go however if anyone but me takes over in i know the competition very well there will be a market crash the likes of which has not been seen before keep america great the trump economy is setting records but not in a good way the u s has the greatest national debt in our history now over trillion and growing as a result of trump s corporate tax cut the u s also has the greatest wealth and income inequality in the last years making it one of the most unequal countries in the world since it is billionaires and multi millionaires who own the bulk of the u s stock market when the president speaks of a market crash he is actually predicting a re balancing of america s unprecedented wealth inequality millions of americans think that would be a good thing if for no other reason than to stop billionaires from buying u s elections according to a white paper released in november from the national bureau of economic research by economist edward n wolff this is how the ownership of the stock market stacked up at the end of the richest percent of households controlled percent of the total value of these stocks though less than its percent share of directly owned stocks and mutual funds there are plenty of losers as a result of the fed s ongoing money spigot to wall street every presidential candidate challenging trump has had his or her arguments against trump s record undermined by a stock market spiking to new highs u s taxpayers are also the big losers the federal reserve s balance sheet is ballooning again as a result of these repo loans and is now back over trillion if its balance sheet is this big now what s going to happen if wall street blows itself up again and the fed has to intervene as a legitimate lender of last resort are we looking at an unthinkable trillion balance sheet at the fed u s taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for any losses at their central bank u s investors and u s citizens are also the big losers a euphoric stock market undermines the case in congress for making the critically needed reforms of wall street s mega banks before they blow themselves up again with derivatives and finally the next generation and their children are the ultimate biggest losers of all by funneling cheap loans to wall street s trading houses instead of using its bully pulpit to demand reforms at the casino like mega banks the federal reserve is aiding and abetting and guaranteeing that the next market crash will be worse than it needs to be that crash will result in more fiscal spending to shore up the economy ballooning the national debt exponentially this will mean that our children and their children will experience a blighted standard of living as more and more of federal tax revenues are diverted to service the debt load instead of going to healthcare education and rebuilding the nation s crumbling infrastructure none of this seems to have been properly deliberated at the fed based on its minutes its main concern appears to be that the wall street banks borrowing from it might end up being stigmatized the insular fed needs a hard reminder from congress as to whose interests it is supposed to serve

1,it s time we restructure our children s school education it s fucking time we live at a point in time where we should be teaching our children values instead of facts we keep jumping up and down yelling how our kids are messed up it s we who are messed up children look up to us and look what we ve gotten force fed into their minds you can see this reflected in the world kids are sexually confused because we sweep our gorgeous body functions under the rug until a certain magical time of puberty where kids suddenly have to find it out themselves we get mad at kids for destroying the way of our life and all this new change we should encourage it have you seen the way the world is we need a new way of living a new way of treating each other and viewing each other we are broken our values are broken and our system is broken we should provide children with all the facts surrounding historical events yeah we needed to drop nuclear bombs on japan but are all the facts ever presented no did you know the emperor was willing to surrender to american forces before the bombs were dropped do we teach all these facts no why because we don t want our children to stand up and say we were wrong there is more than our point of view and we need to teach our kids that why don t we ask our kids how better we could have handled it cultivate their critical thinking their values cultivate their mind and let them think of a better way that we could have handled things this is a new generation of thinkers we are grooming and look at what we do to them we trim down their thoughts and make them think a certain way and god forbid you have a critical thought about an unpopular opinion it s sick twisted and i am disgusted by how we teach our children we should all be ashamed of what we have taught our kids we don t teach our kids to love all there is we don t teach them unconditional love our world is running amok because of what we refuse to teach our kids things we say we will teach them ourselves but never do we wonder why kids take to the streets wave their flags cover their faces they are trying to get our attention our young people scream at us there must be a better way yet we do not hear them we don t want to hear them we don t want to face that bitter truth we certainly refuse to help them critically think in schools we want them to think we ve been doing everything right when we really have been doing everything wrong we then point fingers at kids and say they are violent they join gangs they fight and do mischievous things well guess fucking what they pleaded to us they rioted they yelled screamed and try to change politics and be heard but they weren t so they joined us in our behaviors and ways young people acting violent because we are violent young people acting crazy because we are crazy because if you can t beat them join them and so that s what kids are doing they see the way we run things now and give up and say i guess this is the way it is might as well take part and fit in how should we educate our young first treat them as spirits we are spirits entering physical bodies and we have forgotten that next we need to introduce them to our world with gentleness and care we need to quit teaching our kids to be ashamed and embarrassed of their own bodies their own sexual functions their own feelings what kind of message do we send when we tell them pleasure is bad why do we place our kids in schools where competition is encouraged and allowed where being the best and learning the most is rewarded where performance is graded and moving at ones own pace is barely tolerated what do our children learn and understand from this why do we not bring out what is naturally found in children and instead seek to put what is unnatural to the child why do we not allow our young ones to learn problem solving critical thinking using the tools of their own intuition and cultivating that awareness and deepest inner knowing rather than the rules and the memorized systems and conclusions of a society that has already proven itself to be unable to evolve by these own methods it teaches yet continues to use them we need to teach concepts not subjects we need a new curriculum built around three basic core concepts awareness honesty responsibility we ve been repeating the same mistakes for thousands of years people yell that schools have no place to teach such values well have parents been doing much teaching on values look around we ve seen what has happened from parents passing down their own values our planet is a mess we don t understand the most basic concepts of civilized societies we don t know how to solve conflict without violence we don t know how to live without fear we don t know how to act without self interest we don t know how to love without condition these are basic understandings and we have not even began to approach a full comprehension of them much less implement them after thousands of years we need to stop sit down together and collect our thoughts quit immersing our children in patterns of past why not start teaching courses such as understanding power peaceful conflict resolution elements of loving relationships personhood and self creation body mind and spirit and how they all function together and by themselves engaging creativity celebrating self and valuing others fairness tolerance diversities and similarities ethical economics creative consciousness and mind power awareness and wakefulness honesty and responsibility visibility and transparency science and spirituality imagine the state of this world if at least half that list was taught in schools and children understood the concepts we have created a society on this planet in which little johnny has learned how to read before getting out of pre school but still hasn t learned to stop biting his brother and susie has perfected her multiplication tables using flash cards and rote memory in ever earlier grades but has not learned that there is nothing shameful or embarrassing about her body schools exist right now to provide answers when they should exist right now to ask questions now tell me why are we still supporting this bullshit educational system let me know your thoughts

1,peak medication how long do you think people under medication will last in a disruption a lot of americans are very heavily medicated i have kept myself pretty healthy and am not taking any kind of meds but i appear to be the exception from the rule in my circles i think that because of the heavily medicated nature of most residents of america if things go berserk the population could be reduced in a rapid matter that is the one thing the elites are not prepared for i am sure most of the very wealthy people in america are medicated to the gills as well trying to obtain eternal life it is said that ray kurzweil s supplement bills total about million yr although he can afford that medicine even kept at vacuum deteriorates after about years and it is unlikely that modern medicine with a bunch of patented processes and ingredients from all over the world and made all over the world as well will be easily reproducible in bunkers i don t think they have the tech to d print the medications as well same for the people taking meth coke etc as distribution channels get disrupted a lot of people will have violent withdrawal syndromes which won t be relieved and will die although they will create as much mess as they can before they expire for most people taking medication is no less routine than having breakfast so not too many people seem to think about it no matter how spacious and well secured one s bunker might be if the master has no way to obtain the chemicals needed to maintain himself it is up to no good i wonder whether it might be the great equalizer people might be thinking about i personally have shunned modern medicine precisely because i kind of saw that someday they won t be available

1, tips from bosnia not my writing unknown source entertaining  porn i am from bosnia you know between and it was hell for one year i lived and survived in a city with people without water electricity gasoline medical help civil defense distribution service any kind of traditional service or centralized rule our city was blockaded by the army and for one year life in the city turned into total crap we had no army no police we only had armed groups those armed protected their homes and families when it all started some of us were better prepared but most of the neighbors families had enough food only for a few days some had pistols a few had ak s or shotguns after a month or two gangs started operating destroying everything hospitals for example turned into slaughterhouses there was no more police about percent of the hospital staff were gone i got lucky my family at the time was fairly large people in a large house six pistols three aks and we survived most of us at least the americans dropped mres every days to help blockaded cities this was never enough some very few had gardens it took three months for the first rumors to spread of men dying from hunger and cold we removed all the doors the window frames from abandoned houses ripped up the floors and burned the furniture for heat many died from diseases especially from the water two from my own family we drank mostly rainwater ate pigeons and even rats money soon became worthless we returned to an exchange for a tin can of tushonka think soviet spam you could have a woman it is hard to speak of it but it is true most of the women who sold themselves were desperate mothers arms ammunition candles lighters antibiotics gasoline batteries and food we fought for these things like animals in these situations it all changes men become monsters it was disgusting strength was in numbers a man living alone getting killed and robbed would be just a matter of time even if he was armed today me and my family are well prepared i am well armed i have experience it does not matter what will happen an earthquake a war a tsunami aliens terrorists economic  uprising the important part is that something will happen here s my experience you can t make it on your own don t stay apart from your family prepare together choose reliable friends how to move safely in a city the city was divided into communities along streets our street to homes had patrols five armed men every week to watch for gangs and for our enemies all the exchanges occurred in the street about kilometers away was an entire street for trading all well organized but going there was too dangerous because of the snipers you could also get robbed by bandits i only went there twice when i needed something really rare list of medicine mainly antibiotics of the french original of the texts nobody used automobiles in the city the streets were blocked by wreckage and by abandoned cars gasoline was very expensive if one needed to go somewhere that was done at night never travel alone or in groups that were too big always two to three men all armed travel swift in the shadows cross streets through ruins not along open streets there were many gangs to men strong some as large as men but there were also many normal men like you and me fathers and grandfathers who killed and robbed there were no good and bad men most were in the middle and ready for the worst what about wood your home city is surrounded by woods why did you burn doors and furniture there were not that many woods around the city it was very beautiful restaurants cinemas schools even an airport every tree in the city and in the city park was cut down for fuel in the first two months without electricity for cooking and heat we burned anything that burned furniture doors flooring that wood burns swiftly we had no suburbs or suburban farms the enemy was in the suburbs we were surrounded even in the city you never knew who was the enemy at any given point what knowledge was useful to you in that period to imagine the situation a bit better you should know it was practically a return to the stone age for example i had a container of cooking gas but i did not use it for heat that would be too expensive i attached a nozzle to it i made myself and used to fill lighters lighters were precious if a man brought an empty lighter i would fill it and he would give me a tin of food or a candle i was a paramedic in these conditions my knowledge was my wealth be curious and skilled in these conditions the ability to fix things is more valuable than gold items and supplies will inevitably run out but your skills will keep you fed i wish to say this learn to fix things shoes or people my neighbor for example knew how to make kerosene for lamps he never went hungry if you had three months to prepare now what would you do three months run away from the country joking today i know everything can  really fast i have a stockpile of food hygiene items batteries enough to last me for six months i live in a very secure flat and own a home with a shelter in a village kilometers away another six month supply there too that s a small village most people there are well prepared the war had taught them i have four weapons and rounds for each i have a garden and have learned gardening also i have a good instinct you know when everyone around you keeps telling you it ll all be fine but i know it will all  i have strength to do what i need to protect my family because when it all s you must be ready to do bad things to keep your children alive and protect your family surviving on your own is practically impossible that s what i think even you re armed and ready if you re alone you ll die i have seen that happen many times families and groups well prepared with skills and knowledge in various fields that s much better what should you stockpile that depends if you plan to live by theft all you need is weapons and ammo lots of ammo if not more food hygiene items batteries accumulators little trading items knives lighters flints soap also alcohol of a type that keeps well the cheapest whiskey is a good trading item many people died from insufficient hygiene you ll need simple items in great amounts for example garbage bags lots of them and toilet papers non reusable dishes and cups you ll need lots of them i know that because we didn t have any at all as for me a supply of hygiene items is perhaps more important than food you can shoot a pigeon you can find a plant to eat you can t find or shoot any disinfectant disinfectant detergents bleach soap gloves masks first aid skills washing wounds and burns perhaps you will find a doctor and will not be able to pay him learn to use antibiotics it s good to have a stockpile of them you should choose the simplest weapons i carry a glock i like it but it s a rare gun here so i have two tt pistols too everyone has them and ammo is common i don t like kalashnikov s but again same story everyone has them so do i you must own small unnoticeable items for example a generator is good but bic lighters are better a generator will attract attention if there s any trouble but lighters are compact cheap and can always be traded we usually collected rainwater into four large barrels and then boiled it there was a small river but the water in it became very dirty very fast it s also important to have containers for water barrels and buckets were gold and silver useful yes i personally traded all the gold in the house for ammunition sometimes we got our hands on money dollars and deutschmarks we bought some things for them but this was rare and prices were astronomical for example a can of beans cost to the local money quickly became worthless everything we needed we traded for through barter was salt expensive yes but coffee and cigarettes were even more expensive i had lots of alcohol and traded it without problems alcohol consumption grew over times as compared to peacetime perhaps today it s more useful to keep a stock of cigarettes lighters and batteries they take up less space at this time i was not a survivalist we had no time to prepare several days before the shit hit the fan the politicians kept repeating over the tv that everything was going according to plan there s no reason to be concerned when the sky fell on our heads we took what we could was it difficult to purchase firearms what did you trade for arms and ammunition after the war we had guns in every house the police confiscated lots of guns at the beginning of the war but most of them we hid now i have one legal gun that i have a license for under the law that s called a temporary collection if there is unrest the government will seize all the registered guns never forget that you know there are many people who have one legal gun but also illegal guns if that one gets seized if you have good trade goods you might be able to get a gun in a tough situation but remember the most difficult time is the first days and perhaps you won t have enough time to find a weapon to protect your family to be disarmed in a time of chaos and panic is a bad idea in my case there was a man who needed a car battery for his radio he had shotguns i traded the accumulator for both of them sometimes i traded ammunition for food and a few weeks later traded food for ammunition never did the trade at home never in great amounts few people knew how much and what i keep at home the most important thing is to keep as many things as possible in terms of space and money eventually you ll understand what is more valuable correction i ll always value weapons and ammunition the most second maybe gas masks and filters what about security our defenses were very primitive again we weren t ready and we used what we could the windows were shattered and the roofs in a horrible state after the bombings the windows were blocked some with sandbags others with rocks i blocked the fence gate with wreckage and garbage and used a ladder to get across the wall when i came home i asked someone inside to pass over the ladder we had a fellow on our street that completely barricaded himself in his house he broke a hole in the wall creating a passage for himself into the ruins of the neighbor s house a sort of secret entrance maybe this would seem strange but the most protected houses were looted and destroyed first in my area of the city there were beautiful houses with walls dogs alarms and barred windows people attacked them first some held out others didn t it all depended how many hands and guns they had inside i think defense is very important but it must be carried out unobtrusively if you are in a city and shtf comes you need a simple non flashy place with lots of guns and ammo how much ammo as much as possible make your house as unattractive as you can right now i own a steel door but that s just against the first wave of chaos after that passes i will leave the city to rejoin a larger group of people my friends and family there were some situations during the war there s no need for details but we always had superior firepower and a brick wall on our side we also constantly kept someone watching the streets quality organization is paramount in case of gang attacks shooting was constantly heard in the city our perimeter was defended primitively all the exits were barricaded and had little firing slits inside we had at least five family members ready for battle at any time and one man in the street hidden in a shelter we stayed home through the day to avoid sniper fire at first the weak perish then the rest fight during the day the streets were practically empty due to sniper fire defenses were oriented toward short range combat alone many died if they went out to gather information for example it s important to remember we had no information no radio no tv only rumors and nothing else there was no organized army every man fought we had no choice everybody was armed ready to defend themselves you should not wear quality items in the city someone will murder you and take them don t even carry a pretty long arm it will attract attention let me tell you something if shtf starts tomorrow i ll be humble i ll look like everyone else desperate fearful maybe i ll even shout and cry a little bit pretty clothing is excluded altogether i will not go out in my new tactical outfit to shout i have come you re doomed bad guys no i ll stay aside well armed well prepared waiting and evaluating my possibilities with my best friend or brother super defenses super guns are meaningless if people think they should steal your things that you re profitable they will it s only a question of time and the amount of guns and hands how was the situation with toilets we used shovels and a patch of earth near the house does it seem dirty it was we washed with rainwater or in the river but most of the time the latter was too dangerous we had no toilet paper and if we had any i would have traded it away it was a dirty business let me give you a piece of advice you need guns and ammo first and second everything else literally everything all depends on the space and money you have if you forget something there will always be someone to trade with for it but if you forget weapons and ammo there will be no access to trading for you i don t think big families are extra mouths big families means both more guns and strength and from there everyone prepares on his own how did people treat the sick and the injured most injuries were from gunfire without a specialist and without equipment if an injured man found a doctor somewhere he had about a percent chance of survival it ain t the movie people died many died from infections of superficial wounds i had antibiotics for three to four uses for the family of course people died foolishly quite often simple diarrhea will kill you in a few days without medicine with limited amounts of water there were many skin diseases and food poisonings nothing to it many used local plants and pure alcohol enough for the short term but useless in the long term hygiene is very important as well as having as much medicine as possible especially antibiotics

1,this subreddit is a bunch of sensationalists nothings gonna happen people have been talking and predicting and prophesying about the end of the world since the world began we re still here the most realistic scenario would actually be an asteroid collision but as you know that is super unlikely but this subreddit talks like it s gonna happen within the next years very unrealistic take your fearporn someplace else better yet enjoy life
1,climate forcing solar flares pole shifts and weather modification technologies are all real science with catastrophic potential that should not be censored on this subreddit i was recently censored for posting a comment telling people to research climate forcing solar flares pole shifts and weather modification technology i ve since send a revised version of what s below to the mods because these topics absolutely need to be taken seriously and will be factors in the coming  it is extremely important that we not censor information like this and research actual science and not give into government fear porn and propaganda climate forcing is a legitimate theory behind climate change it primarily resolves around the cyclical nature of the sun and its effect on the earth s temperature and weather yes the sun dictates most of earth s weather this is a scientific fact there s far more evidence for climate forcing driving climate change than there is carbon green house gases and even nasa is including it in their models for the past years climate forcing discussing climate forcing is an emerging scientific study and it is not climate change denial this is how climate change actually works the nonsense spewed by the un and most us positions is propaganda so they can implement their carbon tax systems carbon tax systems are not about stopping or protecting us from climate change they re about taxation and limiting people s access to energy for the purposes of controlling the masses denying climate forcing is denying climate change if people don t understand what s actually happening then they cannot prepare the idea that only the un and politicians can dictate science when they aren t scientists is absolutely insane we need to be able to discuss actual science from actual scientists the data behind climate forcing and the sun being the primary driver of climate forcing is very real could be a major if not leading factor in a coming  in our lifetimes which brings me to solar flares uh yeah they happen and can and have knocked out the power grid before a solar flare could easily knock out our power grid for an extended period of time and easily cause a societal  if we get hit by a single major solar flare or worse yet a series of solar flares you can say goodbye to most modern technology pole shift also real according to nasa we even had to update our gps systems recently because the pole shift is happening much more rapidly than predicted theories around the effect of a pole shift vary from simply being geomagnetic to globally catastrophic according to leaked cia documents as for weather modification it is also real weather modification technology dates well back to ww the usa china and russia are all heavily involved in weather modification technologies and methods and more recently there s been speculation of weather control satellite technologies being deployed globally most of this info comes from occasional disclosure and declassifications and leaked documents but rest assured weather modification technology is real it is used regularly if not daily by world governments and is very likely having catastrophic consequences on global weather systems due to the unknown butterfly effect of such technologies china has been the most open about their use of said tech as they re currently trying to terraform their desert regions climate forcing alone has the potential to cause a societal  so do solar flares a cataclysmic pole shift and possibly even weather modification technology as it could be weaponized and potentially already was during the first cold war much of the information released by the un and other world governments surrounding climate change is propaganda and a half truth as best that is and not based on actual science the us government doesn t even disclose their weather control programs like the chinese and russians do who both do it openly and brag about it they re trying to use climate change as they describe it as a method to control the world s populations and implement their social control systems climate change is real happening and will be a likely factor in the coming  but the reasons of why it is happening have very little to do with the explanations we re being given by our governments much of the climate change is the result of climate forcing from the cyclical patterns of the sun and perhaps the coming pole shift of course pollution is a factor that does have an impact on human health but pollution s effect on the weather is marginal compared to the effect the sun has on the planet arguably the latest data and research indicates the sun dictates of weather on earth and much of this is backed by scientific research and things like carbon make less than a overall difference don t get me wrong green houses gasses aren t good and do need to be controlled but they need to be controlled for health and pollution reasons and taxing the air we breath isn t going to solve anything or stop the oil companies from being oil companies it is extremely important to separate the science and data from the politics to understand what is actually happening in reality and what we re being purposely misinformed about by world governments to control us so we cannot survive the coming  without them the last thing the powers that be want is for us to have access to self sustaining free energy they cannot tax or charge us for people need to understand the actual science behind what climate change is and how it actually works and how the coming  is actually going to play out what the world governments are telling is a half truth at best they cannot be trusted and no taxation is not going to solve climate forcing from the sun we need to be able to talk about what is actually going to drive  the evidence is right in front of our faces please don t censor this kind of information it s real it s happening and it s all going to be major factors in the coming 
1,does anybody else feel like the anti vaxx movement will be the catalyst for a civil war in the united states i ve been seriously wondering for years now when a civil war will break out in the united states i know that i m not the only one but now with the anti vax movement being widespread and it having tangible negative effects on the entire population i feel like the animosity between the population is reaching its boiling point on the one hand vaxxers are tired of having to live through a prolonged pandemic thanks to anti vaxxers and on the other anti vaxxers will start to feel like the government is forcing them to get vaccinated which they of course view as a huge infringement on their rights among other insane shit like g wtf i feel like this is a recipe for absolute disaster and the us is in for a rough ride
1,if the  is going to happen and people aren t talking about solutions i think i found one i need a critic history does not repeat but it may rhyme the current structure as does all life has come of age and nature dictated evolution is knocking at the door there are too many layers of abstraction in the global economy caused by siloed and badly managed data the current management of these companies are resistant to change as to attempt to keep power but due to an ever evolving world of which they have not been trained to deal with the world is already building a replacement for these unfair and unworthy businesses the solution is called blockchain or better known as distributed ledger technology and was invented by human beings their identity is still unknown today it not about the technology rather how it provides a way for middlemen to be removed and the flattening of inter party processes and is simply the next evolution of central ledger of which the global economy has relied on to enable trust in value creation thus far trust is key if animals are to collaborate effectivity with the limited resources we have as a species it should be core priority to ensure that our economy is fair efficient and also trusted by everyone who uses it regardless of position or birthplace if the only acceptable outcome of this challenge of efficiency providing basic human rights to all billion people ensuring we become sustainable living on our home planet maybe we stand a chance of surviving what is to come for if there is no we there is neither i

1,the one thing citizens cant store up a while back i looked into storing a limited amount of gasoline in case of a oil crisis basically you cant stockpile oil you can but its dangerous so for all practical purposes individuals cannot stockpile oil but industrial companies and governments can sounds obvious enough but that simple fact seems to have major implications when an oil crisis occurs individual citizens are almost immediately caught with nothing while corporate government interests hold all the cards and theres basically no way to protect yourself from a future oil crisis minus opting out of the system all these cities interstates everybodys job hospital grocery store we drive between every part of our lives but we drive on a very short leash one false move and we are screwed and there is no way to protect ourselves i can save up money food water medicine wood heck i can apparently stockpile assault weapons but i cant stockpile oil and thats the bottom line
1, prevention subreddit meta to be blunt i feel like this sub is more focused on jerking themselves off to a doomsday prophecy than trying to find ways to remedy the in all ways real upcoming  i m hardly a researcher or a political activist of importance but is there a subreddit which focuses more on what can be done and if that isn t the case would anyone here want to join a new one

1,the viewpoint of the divided states of america from a foreigner perspective or from within for the most part where i am it seems like america is the center of the universe and everything revolves around it i have noticed this at times with world media and even here like if america did  then it would presumably mean that the world has ended as we know it but it appears that there are plenty of countries that are likely more together i don t know if this is still the case as it was a year ago post covid and am rather curious about an outsider perspective whether you believe it is getting worse or better so with that i guess my question is two sided or i would like it be answered from two different perspectives what is the viewpoint of america from an outsider foreigner perspective do you believe that it will decline what do you think will happen what have you been told what do you think of america itself do you believe it is better then your country divided united acting smart stupid thoughts and lastly the next part comes from within as in from people who live in america it is largely the same question as the first i personally feel that things have gotten stranger and more divided and from a  standpoint a bit faster but am curious to know what others think especially from an outsider perspective

1,thoughts on u s  from a utility worker hello i wanted to offer my thoughts on u s  in the context of my experience working for local government utilities for the last years in several different states most of my experience is with water sewer wastewater and streets though at one point or another i ve touched data related to almost every facet of local government i work in the southern us in a mostly it capacity and interact a lot with crews out in the field i don t want to identify myself further if thats ok in a nutshell i think most local governments are in a sorry state not just financially but in terms of workforce and future outlook the american ideal of getting things for as cheap as possible is alive and well in my industry well you get what you pay for as a result of this mentality many utilities are running on skeleton crews with underpaid staff even though they can be killed and sometimes are killed working with dangerous machinery most local governments are incredibly dependent on property or sales tax especially since so many have pivoted towards tourism in the last few decades so when the economy is up revenue is good but the workload is crazy when things go down the workload goes down but we have no money and can t hire anyone there is no way to ever really get ahead people take for granted the things that utility and local gov workers do every day to make basic daily life possible repairing water line breaks and downed power lines cleaning out sewer lines patching streets parcel transactions so people can buy and sell property these things take competent staff who have knowledge and the resources to do the job the american society of civil engineer s latest report card gives america s infrastructure a grade of d billions of gallons of drinking water are lost every year due to aging water pipes and a large percentage of the work force is getting close to retirement its hard to bring young people into an industry that is dangerous requires being on call and often pays crappy wages a third of the nation s bridges need to be repaired or totally replaced you get the idea unfortunately i don t see any of this getting much better everywhere i have lived asking people to pass for example a cent gas tax increase to help repair roads causes an uproar americans just don t have the right mentality for us to have broadly functional local government at least in europe people seem to understand the value of having government institutions that can actually work as we move further into  more strain will be placed onto these entities and they may suffer a kind of internal  of their own we have created a way of life where we de facto subsidize the extravagant fantasy lifestyles of the super rich while the necessities of modern life are crumbling i foresee a future of more potholes more water main breaks intermittent power broken bridges and an angry citizenry who doesn t understand why these necessities are not there flying the flag and talking about how great this country is won t fix these problems we have only ourselves to blame

1,thoughts on our coming debt slavery it occurred to me the other day that with the coming events in the s no green or other revolution will happen instead a new form of slavery may develop the events i m talking about are historic levels of household debt oil in physical and political decline bringing down the average standard of living dramatically increased automation in all collared jobs think robots self driving vehicles etc talk of the need for universal basic income since we see no sign of it currently i see no reason why banks will forgive us our household debt instead with no hope of paying back what we owe we may end up as indentured servants to the corporations and banks i can see work for food and housing programs developing where a certain portion of our work goes to paying off our debts perhaps even turning into multigenerational debts on top of that if any government implements universal basic income that public money will go straight to the with us barely seeing it and worst part will be we won t care as long as we have cheerios a crappy apartment the internet and legal pot we will not start a revolution edited for formatting

1,if amazon worker strike comes to fruition for an enough period of time it will trigger the next great depression in the coming months and why america is a great big bubble predicted by michael burry by the big short if anybody here is familiar with how amazon actually it is run on general labour its a logistics company that managed to monopolize ecommerce and built into a nice fcking trillion dollars in a span of guess how long two years it almost increased its value x its worth in the past two years i am rounding up of course amazon is a soulsucking company built on the broken fundamentals of the current market and its in reality worthless amazon has managed to build themselves this massive corporation because they had a great idea but they used it to maximize as much money as they can make because america amiright and fuck everything else right amazon kinda works like this some dude or company lists a product on the website so it goes in an amazon warehouse and just sits there and there is a fuckton of it everywhere now these warehouses are basically a massive jungle of mountains of products imagine hiking for hours every day and its not even chill this is the only reason amazon pays more than the minimum wage is because the job is complete shit so lets say a dude orders something in new york lets say a big ass tv but the dude selling it has this big ass tv somewhere else some guy in a warehouse moves that big ass tv to be put in a trailer and that trailer goes to new york and gets moved by some guy in a truck that gets delivered to you by your delivery dude this is what an amazon warehouse worker does move boxes from point a to point b varying from sizes and weights from a tiny little box to a big ass tv in multiples of either or for hours a day it doesn t matter how it has to be moved and amazon also gives quotas to maintain to avoid paying more dudes and amazon move alot of shit hundreds of thousands of boxes across north america to pay a premium to poor jeff bezos to pay his billions of alimony just look up the most recent employee reviews on amazon amazon is worthless because without labour nothing will move the pandemic has already slowed down deliveries from a guaranteed two day delivery to two week delays because these warehouses are getting bombarded with orders on an already weakening roster no boxes moving no easy money and a trillion dollar company crashes funny thing is no one gives a shit about amazon there is plenty of shit to buy online amazon is worth about of the trillion total of the current stock market then you have walmart target fedex etc it is a pretty sizeable chunk along with all the other corporations clueless what to do and with the oil crashing its a little bit unstable and there is a bubble in america explained here by the big short guy tldr trillions of dollars have been invested in the past decade unto index funds as they were meant to be the safe investment in the market this influx of cash has ballooned the stock market as investment in these funds trickle down to a select number of companies corporation deemed safe like amazon walmart target fedex thus inflating individual stocks beyond what they really should be and more if these corporations indvidually fail to a point where it causes a huge dent into these index funds and a massive sell off can happen that will crash the whole thing altogether

1,full credits to u lilchnkyskrtn op read trump losing is key to future civilization says ex trump insider this isn t just trumps fault this is the result of americas decline that s been happening for decades trump may be the harbinger of our demise but it s our collective failure as a society that put us in this position president trump is the symptom of disease not the cause of it the u s will not recover from the impending depression that will be caused by among other things the coronavirus pandemic foreign interference in our elections economically unsustainable practices such as record wealth inequality maintaining a national debt greater than the gdp and the lack of preparedness for rising sea levels and increased frequency of natural disasters caused by climate change americans are already over incarcerated undereducated overworked and underpaid most workers scrape by paycheck to paycheck with an ineffective social safety net and are sick from pesticides and hormones in the food supply heavy metals and toxic chemicals in the water supply and pollutants in the air the u s is facing the perfect storm of challenges for which its people would apparently rather become dangerously addicted to delusions than to be mildly inconvenienced by precautions the american spirit that took astronauts to the moon and back has been replaced by a weakness of character such that americans will sacrifice every opportunity to grow and challenge themselves for the comforting ideas of nostalgia and preserving the unwarranted sense of infallible superiority furthermore the ability of the u s to attract and retain the brightest minds on the planet has deteriorated due in large part to the rising tide of ethnocentric ultra nationalism and anti intellectualism even decades after the beginning of the retreat of liberal democracy that started during the cold war america could still claim to be at least somewhat hospitable towards foreign cultures and unconventional ideas that claim can no longer be reasonably justified with the advent of the internet the voices of the intolerant became amplified their desire to divide americans and lay claim to its territories and institutions became material and the freedoms won by the civil rights movement became irrelevant or otherwise diminished the only remaining incentive the rest of the world has in continuing to tolerate america is the presence of us naval might policing the seas against pirates undeniably global trade is contingent upon safe travel over waters the world order under american naval dominion is a necessary evil that is unlikely to persist as internal economic strife erodes the ability to fund american fleets unfortunately thanks to inconsistent and erratic foreign policy decisions many countries are starting to realize american intervention is more of a liability than an asset america flexing its military superiority by acting unilaterally has exposed the sinister element of public expenditure by means of the blood of the innocent and american tax dollars all for private profits america alone is responsible for becoming the toxic partner in its relationships because it so consistently abuses the trust of anyone whom allows it sooner or later all of these issues will culminate into a problem that cannot be hidden in a can and kicked down the road i suspect that time is now the american empire has fallen and only americans don t know it yet if things go back to normal and i still believe it s possible things will go back to normal we better not lose sight of issues that so critically weakened us the fight americans face to reclaim exceptionalism is going to last well beyond our lifetimes should we make it that far redeeming the exceptionalism of the united states of america is a challenge upon which no one person may be rightfully expected to succeed it s up to all of us to be good citizens and better americans only upon the foundation of unity can a better union be built
1,pasqualino seven beauties lina wertmuller a film about survival the madness of humanity and  submission statement this film deals with a flawed and perhaps detestable man navigating terrible times and doing what he needs to in order to survive it is in parts amusing and sad  is explicitly discussed in the film by a spanish political prisoner whose words profoundly affect the central character once the nightmare is over a beautiful film and i believe should find a compelled audience in this subreddit really quite a memorable film i saw years ago and have never forgotten i hope you all enjoy i d like to thank the mods for helping me out with technical complications and for being so reasonable thanks mods the full movie

1,global warming degrees give us a false sense of control maybe obvious to this crowd but i think it s worth pointing out on a regular basis that the degrees degrees shorthand for talking about climate change mainly solve a pr problem for scientists how to easily explain what s happening to non scientists somehow that pr solution got turned into image of a state of the art oven where you can set the temperature to whatever you like most mainstream articles i come across describe climate in this way as if you could literally peak all fossil fuels on a specific year and get average degrees this of course is average which means when we hit degrees there will plenty of places in the world far beyond when you are at you aren t fucking safe this other idea is a carbon budget this was also a pr job to explain something complicated but it got twisted into something like a personal monthly budget this isn t a fucking credit limit where the card declines once you hit the max try to imagine a budget in which as you near your budget limit you start getting progressively penalized it isn t a line it s a debt collector who keeps taking more and more the closer you get to the limit that isn t a budget it s a torture device the idea that we will hit degrees in while extreme in comparison to some moderate views is still conceptually garbage dynamic systems don t cross lines they don t hit marks this line is an average for fuck s sake is a completely arbitrary year the coral reef doesn t fucking know it s the start of a decade if it s and we will hit degrees by and you think you have time oh good i have time i have time no relation to reality we are putting arbitrary numbers onto a system that has does not work by numbers at least our simple pr digestible ones i know the  is coming but i ve got years that s anti science that s not the reality that s just as much hopium as thinking that we are going to tweak some nobs on the global economic system and gradually manage a transition there aren t easy ways to talk about this so talking about degrees etc and carbon budgets is probably what we have to use but i think we should keep in mind that even when we use these words to describe  we are still giving ourselves a security blanket thinking that our language is somehow able to capture define and in a way control what s happening

1,i want to bomb this entire planet i want to completely obliterate every inch of this fucked earth a cyclone of death destruction and decay consumes everything the very nature of this earth is to be born without consent be lied to behind your back be betrayed backstabbed maimed and slaughtered by everything around you every person you meet only doesn t murder you because there is consequence every decision you make is made by the subconscious there is no free will only predicted futures based on the past there is no meaning to it and possibly the only way out is a nothing a non existent which we are bred to fear ruled purely by only our capable concepts that we have limited grasp on yet we think we completely understand and the happier we become the less aware we are to everything shackled to the ground by the laws of physics and nature to never be broken and to be an eternal slave to a world we believe we has us by the neck in reality it means nothing and we can do as we please but either way if multi dimension theory is to be believed then we are the one that purely exists for sadistic depressing and agonising ends
1,dear collapsniks tl dr r  has always been two things to me gawking at the crazy shit happening everywhere all the time and talking about death to put it bluntly where s the death ok now i ll talk about me this may be a very long post but i don t know because i m writing it right now i m essentially a former depressed incel nerd that very recently found his voice and now shouts it across the world because of fixed mind through therapy and psychedelics i used to be some overwatch playing band geek who was completely disconnected from his sexuality i hardly had friends and the few i had were xbox nerd incels just like me so any notion of real romantic entanglement can be completely eschewed now though after months of therapy rigorous self reflection and mental improvement and moderate use of weed and acid which equates to weed every other day and acid never more than once every two weeks fair warning for anyone who needs the info never fuck around with drugs too much acid can literally destroy your psyche and mental state respect it and it will respect you back same should go for everything especially acid know that people s bodies are different and react differently to things not only do you react biologically differently from others but where an acid trip may revitalize your friend s entire world view it may traumatize and confuse you you must understand psychedelics well to get that so here s a paragraph on psychedelics psychedelic can show you anything you want meaning they can show you the greatest time in your life to your most anxious or sad hours of pain in your life you should have a full understanding of your mind and self never dive too far in head first if you must do them but i wouldn t as they re terribly fun start slow and safe to be terse and needlessly profane don t be a retard when you take drugs for example my friend took grams of mushrooms because he thought that was a good idea this is getting its own paragraph only ever do psychedelics if you want to never on a whim make good decisions all of you now to me again after my last trip i love everyone and have said whatever whenever because i feel like that i ve now met an absurd amount of random people simply because i talked to them just today i met a gardener who owns an organic gardening company who talked to about life a drunk old man who gave me a cold la croix and a farmer named poki who invited me to his communal farmland and i m ok with girls now when i think about death how it happens is irrelevant i may experience shock anxiety sadness and most likely pain but it s nothing we all can t overcome i can say with confidence that i d self immolate if it would actually change anything but aren t we all sure it won t some people are uncomfortable with pain some people may like to look at world news and try to calculate how likely they are to die in a certain way maybe even an entire subreddit is it a tornado for me how about flooding hurricane blizzard heat wave fish cow pig livestock animal biodiversity habitat loss how am i gonna go will i starve some people hope not with their permaculture and community and some may be right but most here aren t doing that we re trapped like an alien in area never escaping attached so who cares how you die maybe i ll die today this hour this minute maybe i ll defy the odds and make it to maybe but probably i ll be somewhere in between maybe june maybe september maybe maybe maybe maybe but to those of us who are truly fucked it doesn t matter accept it and we can talk about it all the great philosophy in the world deals with our own mortality the christians thought they should be good and believe in the lord the muslims were a little more ritualistic and had a different god the jews were doing jew things the stoics approached death with open arms and thought even suicide was acceptable if it was indeed what you truly wanted they reveled in discomfort and sought to think this here is the joy of talking of death openly actually thought provoking posting and ability to talk about anything so you can be a better you where the nukes drop is hardly important if one goes they all do so instead talk to one another solve problems come to terms with your mortality your illnesses just talk about it so those around you i e your internet pals can help you be the best you there s nowhere to go but up so come with me didn t proofread so lemme know if there s mistakes

1,so what are we supposed to do then having read the hothouse paper that was in the news last week i no longer really believe that there are any feasible ways that humanity will stop catastrophic climate change causing a mass extinction and killing almost all people in the world before i believed that if i moved north did all the right things became self sufficient with food etc then i might stand a chance at survival how does one find meaning in life if there is nothing to plan for no way of surviving no way of leaving a legacy so to speak because there will be no humans in years i don t want to just  into hedonism either because that doesn t fulfil me i also don t see how i can ignore this and just live a normal life most of the philosophical answers to this question seem to only apply if there is something to come after you what s the point in doing good things if every human being will be dead in years what is the common good in this scenario i m not depressed or suicidal or anything so please don t just send me the suicide hotline and say seek help i m just confused i guess
1, personality profile update greetings once again to r  niks i m dropping back in to fill in on the  personality profile survey preliminary demographic results as you might expect if you have been haunting the doom o sphere for a while most kollapsniks are white males from north america however a larger percentage than expected are females around age distribution is also more varied than expected education level tends to be high baccalaureate degree or above for more than half of respondents i have a link to the demographic results full stats to date stickied on r global i am leaving the survey open for another week to collect more data on personality types and iqs of the  community if you have not yet taken the survey you have another week before i run the spreadsheet and tally the results to that point
1, scenario society is very reliant on cheap oil there is projected to be a shortage of cheap oil between shale and tar sand oil are very expensive and can never fill the gap left by cheap oil imports are going to be very expensive most people will lose their jobs most people will not be able to pay their debt because most dept cannot be paid money becomes worth very little very little of society can operate on expensive oil for the last one hundred years we have created a civilization incredibly reliant on cheap oil it is reasonable to expect anarchy when there is no more cheap oil

1,its not only a self righteous president george bush who uttered such admonition it is time for america to examine our tragic failures while deeming himself impenitently irresponsible for his own doings its someone else fault is everyone s attitude such we all push  forward here the acid article i got the inspiration from the hypocrites yes there is this tendency for cheap talk and no action and us being the perpetrators of what we lament about
1,c reductions in years it gets worse climate analytics researcher claire fyson says we must reduce emissions in years to avoid c queued minutes yet new research says that non modelled wetland and permafrost emissions will knock years off our carbon budget for staying under c does this mean we have years to reduce emissions to stay under c i don t know but wouldn t be surprised stefan rahmstorf says we must reduce emissions in years to avoid c queued i remember reading a book about oil in the s called the seven sisters it said that oil demand supply never diverged from each other by more than from this includes both world wars in peak oil was big news and i bet it was foundation this sub was built on i believe peak oil precipitated the financial crisis this was before the fracking boom but since fracking emissions are x higher than reported anthony ingraffea says we will lock in c by which is years earlier than what stefan says does this mean we only have years to reduce emissions i don t know but i suspect neither does anyone else the problem is that the c lock in point will be reached some years before the planet actually reaches that temperature it s taken a years for the planet to reach c warmer it will take years for us to actually see c probably around the problem with c is that multiple tipping points are triggered below that actual temperature the problem with tipping point trigger events is that one tipping point triggers another tipping point which then triggers another and so on and so forth this chain reaction can lead to cascading  of negative forcings relative to positive forcings and lead to an unstoppable irreversible runaway hothouse planet the tipping points triggered below c are as follows the west antarctic ice sheet the greenland ice sheet arctic summer sea ice coral reefs go figure you can see a modified chart of the schellnhuber chart here queued the world economy only grows at exactly the rate our energy demand grows which is around per year without massive consumer demand destruction earth will die and massive consumer demand destruction means massive economic destruction there is no easy way out of this this means no new iphones no new cars etc etc it means instead of several shared online devices we ll have to start sharing them for young people the idea of sharing a single phone in the house is incon fucking ceivable there are types of deniers those who deny climate change and those who deny climate  so when michael she mann tells you that green energy will save us he s talking through his ass signed the ass whisperer
1,climate change denial justification so i have a friend whom i debate with occasionally on facebook usually it s about politics but today we got into vaccines and then climate change he tried to justify his position by citing a study on average temperatures that he d been told was falsified and unrepeatable a quick google search and i was able to show him that not only had the study been independently verified but it had been repeated by both the original researchers and other scientists using varying methods which all confirmed the original conclusion that we re at the highest average temperature of at least the last and possibly the last million years so then he started quoting rush limbaugh and after a little research i came across a quote that made me sick i will never debate this friend again because i now realize there is no arguing with him for him it is all about belief and not fact the quote was this i just intellectually cannot accept the fact that a loving god which has created all this beauty and has blessed this country i cannot believe that a god like that would punish the human being he created for progress for improving the quality of his life this is what we re dealing with not only do we have to worry about the guy that doesn t care as long as he s making a buck but we also have the nutjobs who can t see past their religious beliefs to the reality staring them in the face sadly i think this will only get worse as conditions deteriorate and people turn to religion for comfort and guidance has anyone else had similar encounters
1,for those of you who think we only have years can i ask what exactly made you come to that conclusion i go from thinking we have another years or so before shtf to thinking we only have about years max years ago it was and it really doesn t seem that long ago the whole covid thing has really made me question how fragile society really is i d be curious to hear your reasons

1,government  policy amp whitepapers help wanted in conversation on the r  discord we got to talking about something which i realized we don t pay nearly enough attention to the thoughts and policies of governments and government bodies relating to  for instance the us dod has been compiling and publishing reports and whitepapers about climate change and the various strategies and adaptations it will require of them for a while now these are highly valuable ideas literally a great deal of resources and effort were put into producing them and all the more valuable for reflecting the thinking of the organization that produced them i am vaguely aware that other public institutions perform similar practices if only in terms of forward planning exercises and often publish them but i don t know how to find them i don t know where to find them what to look for what the difference is between a serious report and something an intern cooked up ideally i m hoping one or two of you actually have experience in this field and can provide a primer guide on how to navigate it for us if the support exists to get this train out of the station i ll start maintaining a set of wiki pages collating all the papers reports etc we find
1,vaclav smil doom smil says energy transitions take at least years if ever to happen when people got sick of coal power and smoggy cars the government promised that hydro power would replace coal which it did not instead it just added to the power use so coal kept growing right along with hydro this is exactly what is happening with renewable power and fossil fuels now we transitioned from wood to coal a few hundred years ago and many still burn wood to this day because dead wood is free in the jungle we got years to get emissions below zero for eternity it takes years to change world energy demand worldwide that s because worldwide means like all over the whole rucking world the plant waste we burn is food for the soil and trees not green energy for us to steal we are changing earth x faster than whatever killed the dinosaurs we are going to run out of food and water before we get renewable energy worldwide

1, book club april s read is the  of western civilization a view from the future by naomi oreskes and erik conway discussion starts may the  of western civilisation is a speculative fiction book that in universe was written in the late s the fictional author takes us through the climate catastrophe that built in strength during the penumbral age so named because it heralded the eclipsing of the enlightenment the era s starting event is the creation of the ipcc and the era covers every failed attempt to stop the crisis from building and it culminated in the  of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets the first chapter deals with the early penumbral age the background and what was known in the period up to the s the second covers the acceleration of the decay events including attempted geoengineering and its failure and the great  in that ended western civilisation the third chapter is where our historian grapples with the paradox of how western civilisation and the world it led had a great many people who knew exactly what was coming and why and yet this same civilisation essentially choose to  the brief epilogue speculates on whether democracy may one day be worth trying again after the story is an interview with oreskes and conway who are the same people who authored merchants of doubt personally though there are very dark hints as to the terrible events that transpired throughout the penumbral age and the  i found the third chapter the most compelling the author s grappling with the question of if we knew this was coming even before if we could see how clearly it was heading towards us then why didn t we save ourselves when we had the chance but unlike the movie age of stupid which posits the same question the  of western civilisation makes an attempt to answer it i won t spoil it but it is a theory that finds traction on this subreddit the book can be found at or from all your favourite capitalist bookstore outlets jeff bezos sells the audiobook the  book club is a monthly event wherein we read a book from the books wiki we keep track of what we ve been reading in our goodreads group as always if you want to recommend a book that has helped you better understand or cope with  feel free to share the recommendation here

1,peak oil is already here the writing is all over the bloody wall this is a very well written in depth article explaining the  of oil with great charts from the energy experts when people hear peak oil they usually assume that means we have reached a point where the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached after which it is expected to enter terminal decline peak can be a result of extractable oil running out or becoming too expensive to extract that peak has been predicted many times incorrectly over the years because new oil fields and new drilling technology has been developed that has provided a fresh supply of oil but the peak we have now entered is not a result of less available oil and is because renewable energy is now even cheaper than the lowest price of cheap oil and electric vehicles are replacing gas and diesel vehicles reducing demand for oil in other words even the cheapest oil is more expensive to extract and refine than renewable energy making it no longer financially viable as an energy source
1,fentanyl is the number one cause of us overdoses the maker of a fentanyl drug was the largest donor to the campaign opposing marijuana legalisation in arizona perhaps this is widely known but i haven t seen it here and i thought it may be of interest given this community seems clued up on the opioid crisis in the us essentially the story is in the headline in august this year a voter initiative to legalise marijuana in arizona proposition was defeated insys therapeutics which makes a best selling fentanyl based opioid donated k to the campaign opposing the initiative it s not hard to understand why marijuana is a highly effective painkiller and in states where medical marijuana is available has been shown to cut into the profits of painkilling drugs fentanyl meanwhile is the number one cause of overdoses in the us deaths from synthetic opioid overdoses have increased to more than a increase in just three years there have been no recorded deaths from a cannabis overdose this is simply another absurd example of how the war on drugs has been used to prop up the profits of big pharma and keep people dependent on the pharmaceutical system despite surging overdoses and the financial and social costs to communities of the opioid crisis in a sane world enabling people to grow their own safe painkilling medication would be the humane logical and loving thing to do while things are changing i feel medical marijuana is also a defensive move by the pharmaceutical industry to maintain a grip on the painkilling industry the one thing that would really hurt them is full marijuana legalisation and as this story shows they clearly know it
1,why the road to hell is paved with hemp or why i don t smoke dope with the pope in the early years of the th century millions of black folks in the congo were murdered for control of the rubber tree plantations that were needed to make car tires cars were the latest greatest thing if you tell a year old man he has to give up his car to save life on earth he ll tell you to go to hell in the early years of the st century millions of black folks in the congo were murdered for control of the exotic minerals our smartphones need to work properly smartphones are the latest greatest thing if you tell a year old they have to give up their smartphones to save life on earth they will tell you to go to hell during the years between all the mass murders in the congo america and europeans sold millions of tons of guns and ammo to poor countries like the congo and all around the world if you tell an american he has to give up his guns to save life on earth he ll tell you to go to hell renewable energy products have a life cycle time of years after which they will all have to be replaced during a time of food water energy and mineral shortages if you tell green energy boosters they have to give up renewable energy to save life on earth they will tell you to go to hell humans and our livestock occupy of the land vertebrate biomass on earth humans and livestock consume of annual land chlorophyll production and caused of land vertebrate species extinction if you tell a meat lover he has to give up meat to save life on earth he will tell you to go to hell james hansen and several renowned conservation biologists composed an open letter to green ngos begging them to stop their opposition to nuclear power in order to save all life on earth he was told to go to hell sometime in less than years life on earth will pass the tipping point for runaway unstoppable irreversible cascading mass extinction  and because climate change is only out of direct drivers of this event then renewable energy will do nothing in time to save all life on earth and i will be told to go to hell you can blame capitalism big banks and monstrous corporate conspiracies for the near term  of life on earth but these things could not exist without us and that is why we are all going straight to hell

1, in europe what s it going to look like i would like to dedicate this thread to europe and hear your thoughts on the near or more distant future of the old continent europe is a very diverse place and described as a safe haven by many in the rest of the world but despite of a food variety and public healthcare systems in most countries europe has its own problems to name a few smog in the winter ongoing migrant crisis in med and middle east weather becoming more extreme every year mild winters and super hot summers wealth disparity between different countries and large migration within the continent growing number of populist politicians look at governments in poland and hungary but also newly elected members of parliament in other countries aging population i suppose some would look at it as a positive public services under increasing stress and the pandemic only amplified that i m sure there are more problems which could be listed here but let s make that a discussion starting point i d like to hear your thoughts and predictions
1,wouldn t america win a nuke war with russia although for some people a nuclear war is unthinkable wouldn t america prevail albeit with a huge cost america s tech is more advanced russia s tech is stuck at that of early s although putin is finally spending some money on missile defense system also america is much more decentralized than russia whose major cities are few and far between after petersburg moscow and one or two probably gorki and novosibirsk russia is done plus america has more placements than russia can ever hope for it won t be possible to destroy every us facility out of north america i think the ww plan to destroy russia and gain is resources is not as absurd as it sounds like although it will bring lots of destruction to the west as well
1,the mismatch between climate change and the optimism bias along with a multitude of other cognitive biases that make us unsuited as a species to tackle climate change is the optimism bias only anecdotal but reading comments on media articles and policy positions i see this optimism bias in full swing the general discourse of those that accept the science on climate change is that we ll still be able to mitigate it we ll somehow miraculously be able to overcome the political inertia create amazing tech or something so at what point does the optimism bias no longer operate i think at the terminal stage the difference between the majority of the population and most on r  is that we ve just joined the dots together far earlier and realised we are already pretty much at terminal stage or if not now we will be in the next few years not sure why we have gained such an early realisation but i guess it gives us more time to prepare
1,the critical energy charts you never see 
1,the real reason technology won t save us technology can t save us is a well worn meme in these parts but i think it obscures a deeper truth that truth is that we aren t even trying to save ourselves with technology because of the way our economy works in other words the real problem is ideological not the power or lack thereof of technology take computers for example imagine the political will existing to standardise computing power and make all components of computers easily replacable that means that the never ending increases in computing power and software size comes to an end people would no longer have to throw away computers because they are obsolete they wouldn t have to keep updating operating systems and buying new software if something goes wrong with their computer they will always be able to buy a replacement component and the old broken component can easily be recycled so its valuable resources won t go to landfill and won t need to be replaced by new resources that have to be mined just imagine the difference this would make in terms of sustainability on its own it wouldn t save civilisation from  but repeated throughout our entire economy it would make a massive difference to our trajectory as a civilisation and make all sorts of new solutions possible but of course no such thing can possibly happen to civilisation as we know it because it would be awful in terms of prospects for economic growth three quarters of software and hardware engineers would be surplus to requirements and opportunities for people at the top to make themselves filthy rich would be severely reduced governments would collect less tax from companies making both software and hardware for this reason such solutions to our problems aren t even considered they are a fairytale but not because the technological answers don t exist but because we are even asking the right questions the real reason technology won t save us is that the people running the show are more interested in preserving existing wealth and power structures than they are in saving civilisation the problem is our cult like obsession with globalised free market capitalism not the inherent impotency of technological solutions to our unsustainability problems as a civilisation we aren t even trying
1,all i see around me is brand new cars on lease high rise apartments and mansions being built and a glut of down this and no interest that commercials do we never learn when george bush went on t v in and no doubt at the behest of his banker buddy advisers basically said everyone gets a home change the rules to make it easier i knew deep in my gut this was wrong i left the military at the end of august dead set on waiting for the economy to tank so i could buy a house as investment while i started college a week or so later the global recession took effect and at that time most folks only had a small inkling of how finance and debt worked in this country thanks to not learning it basically ever in school and even then i had a bad feeling that we were not only over spending but worse over borrowing and we all know how that ended i bought that house at the bottom but now it s time to sell now admittedly i have always been bear and more recently globally  aware but even now as i live in la and seeing the events of i m amazed to see it s all being repeated ad nausea and to bigger effect it astounds me when i ride around and see so so many brand new low mpg cars driving around with dealer plates still hummers have even made a comeback here how can the average american convince themselves to take on this new debt all the sudden oh i know it s all the commercials that have resurfaced offering crazy low rates no income verification etc all over again i listen to the radio on my motorcycle and it s ad after ad of these payday loan scams and for profit colleges advising people to take on more debt car buyers are now challenging college students and homeowners for the title of most clueless borrower we really haven t learned our lesson and the rich know this i work for a type and new construction of mansions is everywhere here and while chinese are colluding with local governments to convert low income housing in to large expensive to rent apartment complexes with storefront space at ground level i see these popping up everywhere from the beach to the valley our wages stagnate inflation is fighting with deflation yet rent and services skyrocket that huge sucking sound of the middle classes wealth draining is never ending it seems what is the outcome of this much of the industrial world is playing catch up much to the planets dismay and has copied all the best and worst of the american dream and their bubble will bring the world down with them i was naive to think would wake up the masses and for a moment maybe it did but we are back to our borrowing ways and might actually believe the rich know how to use our money better than we do the sequel directed by michael bay

1,the power of panic i don t think the west will really  in the next years but i do think they will be the people most prone to panic which i think might work in some terrible way to hasten and worsen the  the recession for example is fueled by speculation and subject to the short term feelings of the masses when  becomes more widespread we re at risk of some serious mob mentality general paranoia panicky shit people will be killed in stampedes running from rumors the panic could drive millions from the coasts or the other cities and spike demand for essential goods droughts and floods and superbugs and lyme disease and hunger will make people hoard more out of the primal fear of not having enough in the next month anyway i wanted to leave this a little more open ended about what you think the role power and risk of panic might realistically be in our near mid term future

1,climate change and the hidden plague of lyme disease it s not just your imagination ticks are out of control this year ss sorry if this post is made redundant by any previous one s and apologies for this being such a long write up for me this one is more personal as my brother has chronic or late stage lyme disease and it s devastated both of our lives with climate change environmental degradation we tend to talk in terms of a reduction of flora fauna think of the classic shifting baseline example of windshields becoming less splattered or the lack of honey and bumble bees with ticks however it s going in the opposite direction there s more of these bastards and thus more tick borne infection tbi the only tick my brother knows about having was in in virginia out side of the traditional ne range i m in scotland right now and it s only beginning to be understood right now that we have a problem with it especially in the highands the past few years every time i talk to friends who just came back from a jaunt up there they come back telling me of being covered in ticks just by sitting down on the grass when i lived in argyll in the west coast of scotland over a decade ago i used to walk off the trail all the time and never remember seeing them when i was a kid in new hampshire back in the s very early s i used to jump in piles of autumn leaves all the time nothing now that sounds like a suicide mission when i was in germany i d get the odd tick on a scout camp and told not to worry as lyme is an american and specifically a new england disease wrong earlier this year my mum in md had a tick even though she has hardly left the house in the past year because of covid presumably my dad had brought it in from working in the yard my brother essentially ordered her to go on weeks of doxycycline my point is is that ticks and therefore lyme tbi s are spreading and becoming more prevalent as the environment changes right now however it is still an almost invisible plague the mainstream medical world by and large is absolutely shit and in denial about this as i have seen with the treatment of my brother over the years he s been wrecked by this disease you talk about having late stage lyme believe me they black list you but inevitably the centre cannot hold and they won t be able to sweep this one under the carpet for much longer it all makes me wonder about a lot of the people i know with seemingly random chronic conditions that doctors label as me or in my brothers case a neurological software problem that they have no interest in investigating further i suppose the only silver lining these days is that long covid is remarkably like lyme disease in how it manifests must be working along similar inflammatory pathways and that they cannot ignore so i m hoping that work with long covid eventually produces some relief for lyme sufferers anyway for me and especially my brother our experience has induced a change in how we view contact with nature i don t look at long grass the same way i used to even in the city and my brother refuses to go to the highlands public awareness is still very poor however at least here it is i ve never read it but there is a book called the salt line by holly goddard jones and the synopsis is thus in an unspecified future the united states borders have receded behind a salt line a ring of scorched earth that protects its citizens from deadly disease carrying ticks those within the zone live safe lives in a society controlled by a common fear few have any reason to venture out of zone except for the adrenaline junkies who pay a fortune to tour what s left of nature once out of zone this group finds itself at the mercy of deadly ticks and at the centre of a murderous plot how far are they are willing to go to get to the right side of the salt line as hyperbolic as it sounds you wonder how long before we in the cushy west face a version degree of this scenario in the not so distant future

1, isn t some idyllic cabin in the woods fantasy before the stone age ended hunter gatherers numbered about million which is the general consensus that was the world s carrying capacity we got most of our calories from plants and some from animals nature didn t plant stuff would could eat in nice neat rows nor maximize that food in relation to many others that we couldn t eat there was also the matter of the ice ages covering ground in northern europe and what not stone age man had to cover a lot of territory to make ends meet then we advanced someone found planting these seeds we didn t like grew more plants horticulture and then agriculture you can say civilization started here for better or worse and indeed the cradle of civilization is considered to be in a fertile crescent mesopotamia modern iran and surrounding it wasn t an easy life but once someone settled down with a group doing this it s likely they repulsed other nomads gathering from their fields thos nomads would also find prime real estate and start defending it so the dominoes went down we found animals we could keep fenced in and they d eat calories we couldn t or wouldn t eat and convert them to calories we would carrying capacity went up and so it went down the line for several hundred years the world s carrying capacity seemed stuck at about million from some would blame plague and what not but this was just a natural consequence of close living and animal agriculture iow it was our natural carrying capacity given the technology at the time later on hygiene in medicine sewers and antibiotics would all up this as did mechanized farming and the haber bosch process fixing nitrogen into the ground faster than the soil bacteria can on their own ie amino acids aka protein so what is the point of all this blather well it s this civilization often burns bridges we can never cross backwards again without great cost it s often a scorched earth policy do you think the world s population could live like hunter gatherers the natural world would be stripped within less than a day of edible wild plants and within a week of wild animals america s million dear has the same meat mass of less than million cattle we keep million cattle at anyone time for comparison likewise we could not farm without petroleum fertilizer that would yield us a world that makes enough food for make billion or billion people at absolute max maybe i m probably being highly optimistic given the amount of farmland that has already disappeared or will disappear in climate change there are people outside the sub and maybe even some newcomers who dream of  as some type of amish simplicity and tranquility of life without intruding technology something that might fit in a henry david thoreau simplicity that s not what s going to happen at least in the actual process maybe a long time afterwards but the process will be ugly brutal terrible and animalistic the techno hopiums kinda sense this all unconsciously they want to keep the treadmill going fusion mars rockets solar system colonization they instinctually know the game and the invisible monster on their backs they have to continually outrun in exponential leaps forward we keep rushing up the ladder because the bottom is on fire and may give in at any time but if there is no techno fix just know that every year the human population spends in overshoot means subsequently less carrying capacity the earth will have once reality pulls us back soil erodes in more and more places co going up another notch or two a few less fish in the sea more areas paved and concreted less forests coming back after a wildfire more and more superbugs evolving on our overuse of antibiotics particularly in industrial animal farming more deadspots in the ocean the higher the roller coaster goes the deeper the inevitable dive
1,proposed changes to shitpost fridays hey everyone we re interested in making a few changes to how friday works based on the recent feedback half of you were interested in changes and half of you weren t we think we might have found some ways to appease both core sentiments on topic memes jokes short videos image posts posts requiring low effort to consume and other less substantial posts would have to be flaired as either casual friday humor or low effort and only be allowed on casual fridays friday would be defined as friday utc saturday utc clicking the times can help you easily determine where this timeframe would fall within your particular region clickbait misinformation and other similar low quality content would still not be allowed at any time not even on fridays we would set bot to automatically allow posts within the designated timeframe or remove them outside it moderators would still have to monitor post flair to make sure it s being used correctly these changes would allow anyone to filter out these types of posts based on their flair if they do not wish to see them reddit does not have this type of feature built in but there would be multiple ways to enable it e g res which we would outline in detail for those interested if we made these changes the general intention here would be to contain friday posts to a consistent established timeframe and enable it so anyone can filter them out if they want to let us know your thoughts on these ideas and what they entail amp xb interested in moderating we re looking for new moderators for r  in all timezones no previous moderation experience is necessary but helpful patience and an ability to communicate in a volunteer environment are the most paramount follow the instructions on this page if you d be interested in joining the team

1,we would all be happier without civilization imagine a world where you didn t have to pay taxes or go to work or sit in traffic or make awkward small talk with your coworkers or get yelled at by your boss for years we didn t have to do any of these things and we were happier than we have ever been we were born into economic and social security our only job was to gather food and hang out with our friends and family we were always together with people who loved us and would do anything to protect and care for us we never had to worry about being homeless or our car breaking down or getting hurt and loosing our job life was simple and of the time totally stress free here people will argue that our stone age ancestors lived brutal lives barely scraping by just long enough to make their th birthday then they died some horrible death to this i suggest you read up on modern stone age people who were still living their natural lives when visited by anthropologists one remark you will find repeated over and over is that these people no matter where in the world they lived were incomparably happy smiles laughter pure joy were the constant state of being the point of this post is that civilization does not make us happy despite many of our beliefs of progress and the wonders of modern medicine and food surplus etc we achieved peak happiness in the stone age we don t know what  will be like but we will definitely be reverting backwards in technology and complexity of human society i believe that we will achieve the simplistic way of life once again that made us as happy as we have ever been technology and progress doesn t make us happy simple living and having a tribe is the most important thing and we will have that once again

0,what comes after corporate capitalism and consumerism when full employment is no longer the goal or is no longer possible due to machines and ai i m curious what you think about the world s economic evolution after oil and after robots ai take more jobs than they create we can t know what new industries will arise at some point it s likely that ai will automate most repetitive i e middle class cognitive tasks and machines will automate or assist much if not most manual labor corporate capitalism has in many cases elevated standards of living across the globe but at the cost of using an extractive exploitative model globalisation essentially seeks the lowest standard of living and pays workers as little as necessary until automation roboticisation can do the job more cheaply so what happens after full employment is no longer a practical goal for global economies what happens when the idea of get an education have a career is completely disconnected from income potential fifty years ago a high school diploma was a decent basic education now high school won t get you very far at all what happens when the same occurs for university and graduate degrees if only because the number of graduates is larger than the number of jobs what happens when robots can adequately perform most factory and shipping jobs if more people are told to re train how can the economy sustain itself when technology keeps making more and more types of productive human activity obsolete what happens when ai gives each office worker the ability to be ten times more productive when we know that companies resist paying workers more for work that is aided by machines as long as the labor market is full of possible replacement workers at the same wage point in the past monarchy was considered the pinnacle of human progress now we have corporate capitalism plutarchy that extracts profit from local economies and redistributes it to less than one percent of the world s population technology enables that process to accelerate faster than ever before robots don t demand more pay an essential aspect of capitalism is to eliminate costs and labor is a cost financial compensation for labor is also how humans survive and spend enabling other humans to survive at some point the current corporate capitalist consumerist model will begin to fail some say that it already is failing and reactionary sociopolitical backlash has already begun so beyond the typical untrue dogma that an infinity of new industries will save us as new technologies are born what comes after the current system p s the after oil bit would have made this post twice as long so that can wait for a separate discussion p p s yes universal basic income ubi is a popular concept there s only one problem corporations actively evade taxation whenever possible even to the point of lobbying and gerrymandering political processes to have leaders elected who protect their interests if raising taxes to sustain a ubi fund is implausible that is not a viable option until the idea of corporate responsibility becomes fashionable again for one reason or another
0,how to make renewable energy a reality we should challenge the natural monopoly status of energy companies at one point perhaps back in the s it was totally logical that electricity could only be effectively generated at the scales required at large centralized power plants with the plethora of renewable and storage solutions available that is simply no longer the case we could start up community run and owned local utility companies we could create programs where optionally you can invest each month when you pay your utility bill in renewable energy i m not saying you would pay more then you are paying now it s a fact that at certain scales and locations renewable energy is simply cheaper then fossil fuel based energy those would be prime locations to start this take over i would love to hear thoughts on this i think if we did it right we could solve wealth inequality

0,developing ai help advice please hi guys i know this is a little off topic and a random turn of events from my life but i would really appreciate any advice you could contribute thanks in advance if you take the time to read this and or drop a reply it is very much appreciated basically i m just your average year old guy who works terrible at science at school got gcse grade c uk for combined sciences and thought i hated it when i was i suffered from severe panic disorder and still do it was at the time from a primary fear of death after speaking with my gp i was referred to talking therapy which basically echoed the message of what ever happens tell yourself that no matter what it will be ok even if it is your time this was fine advice but in order to be ok with everything i would have to accept death i tried to try and investigate why i was so scared of death and that journey has led me onto the pursuit of ai and the advice i d appreciate is how i could expand on this to cut a longer story long the best method i could find to describe to death i believe describes the fundamentals of intelligence which could be used to create artificial intelligence i ve been working on this idea mainly in my head for the best part of months now and i would like to get some feedback on it too i ve tried to stay away from reading ai publications deliberately so if there are any overlapping points sorry the theory i used to describe and investigate death was a theory called entanglement which i believe is a branch of string theory i m not a scientist but i think in laymen terms entanglement is basically two particles in sync with each other the example i read was that if two particles were entangled a visualisation is that if one is spinning clockwise the other would be spinning counter clock wise the main sticking point of entanglement is that if one particle is stopped measured then the other entangled particle will also stop regardless of distance apart meaning that some form of message could be sent to the other particle over a scale which would create a desired speed much greater than the speed of light albert einstein called it spooky action at a distance in theory if information can be moved from particle to particle almost or perhaps instantly then this can be used as a basic teleporter for information or instructions on how a particle should behave i ve seen various studies which claim to entangle particles together on basic levels however in theory if information can be transferred from and to entangled particles then there could be a process which could record all the particles in a human body or anything else and in essence teleport them to another location this does sound very farfetched and realistically it does not matter if you believe in the theory or not the main breakdown of science is when a human is created using this method let s say although farfetched that a human being was located in london and all the particles in their body were recorded and sent to an equal amount of entangled particles in new york the argument would be if the human compiled in new york would be the same as the one in london although it would be almost guaranteed that in order to record all the particles in a humans body the original set would be destroyed so meaning that the human in london would be killed whilst the copy human in new york would be created would the human in new york be the same person as the one in london even though all of the particles present in their body is the exact same make up of the on in london there would be absolutely no difference in cells between the two versions there are arguments that the human in new york is the exact same human as london as all the cells would be identical the human in new york would be convinced they are the same person and it s a strong argument however if the human in london was not destroyed and flew to new york to meet the new them the copied version would not be the same person as the original was still here in regards to my investigation into what happens when you die if the original individual was still here then there must be something local in regards to life as by the time the two humans in question met they would be more like identical twins than identical people the original human would be normal and still experience death regardless if they were copied or not there is something that makes you you and it cannot be transferred i then tried to turn this around by thinking about what would happen if two humans were made in new york both would be convinced that they are the original human however after a small amount of time they would be more like identical twins rather than the same person the idea that they would be constantly speaking in sync with each other or moving the same would be in my eyes wrong there are too many variables to intelligence that would make a split almost instantly for example the breath of air each human took would have a different composite of oxygen co and nitrogen meaning that over a larger amount of time their breathing would be changed heart beat changed also when they are looking at each other the light reflected off each other would be different and all these subtle changes would add to two different people these subtle changes are interpreted by our brains and they adjust our life accordingly i call these static references a key part of intelligence small apparent insignificant changes can create a total different life trajectory which are invisible to everyone as they are no benchmarks i e copies of ourselves that s basically an overview of my journey into discovering my passion for ai the advice i need is how could i pursue my passion for ai i ve got a few months of downtime before i need to look for a new job and would like to use this time to try and come up with a plan due to my need to be earning i m not well off by any means i cannot take time out to go back to uni or risk too much to pursue this choice i do try and maintain researching the topic in my spare time but can sometimes feel disheartened by the fact i can t do it full time there are loads of problems associated with ai which i would like to get my head around the biggest one is why would we want to build ai along with some problems i ve dubbed as data drag system drag and fortified data

0,why science needs philosophy and philosophy needs science nowadays science and philosophy are often defined with strict boundaries scientists engaging in philosophical questions get accused of overstepping the boundaries of their discipline and philosophers talking about scientific issues are largely ignored sometimes justifiably for a lack of insight into the scientific work that has been done already this however is a mistake what we call science has historically been called natural philosophy this is something we should not forget as psychology has only recently detached itself from philosophy instead philosophy should be seen as a form of highly abstract science this is similar to wilfried sellars definition of philosophy as the striving for an understanding of how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term science without philosophy then would really just be a restricted stale and instrumental form of science lacking a fundamental part of what it means to understand the world we live in amp xb

0,what kind of virtual reality will our future hold something i have always wondered is if we will just continue to work upon the virtual reality foundation that has already been set for example in the future will we take what are the current vr headsets and add things like smell or other senses or will we stray from what we already know i have always thought what if we created some form of virtual reality or just computer displays in general where what is now used such as pixels and polygons i am using gaming as an example is erased completely and we have found a way to put our brains in an almost dream like state where the brainwaves are altered and what we perceive is another world cancelling out our real world stimuli and replacing it with that of another world through something like a microchip in the brain or some sort of headset that interferes with brainwaves i am aware that this full dive technology has been talked about before but what i am curious about is if what we already know about displays and vr in general will be discarded and replaced with a better system what do you think when do you think it will happen tl dr will the pixel be eradicated allowing for true full five technology that is indistinguishable from reality
0,the future of humanity as a result of the continuance of human evolution we as humans are capable of perceiving our world with more than the basics senses when can we recognize the senses that aren t visible or tangible the supplementary forms of perception that add an extra dimension to the way we feel through this world for example inter psyche intra brain frequencies remember the tube televisions we all had as kids even if the sound was off or in a different room as you walked down the hall while approaching the television couldn t you feel that the television was turned on even without seeing it that television is omitting invisible inaudible frequencies that our brains are capable of detecting this innate sensory is known as psycho acoustics and is a basic form of intangible inter psyche intra brain communication with the world around us now whether your fundamental beliefs are based out of science or religion we can all agree nature has balance where there is good there is also evil positive charges counter negative charges god in heaven with lucifer in hell males and females correct now if our mind can detect and receive these frequencies shouldn t the laws of nature allow for us to also send frequencies some roll their eyes when the word psychic is mentioned but just consider for a moment that it is possible certain select individuals do possess these abilities also consider that just like any other human ability it won t always be perfect or perform at a superior level i have the ability to jump but i am not the highest jumper in the world nor does my jump reach my maximum height each time some people may possess this remarkable talent while others don t and the ability may not always be relied on without fail but occasionally we are able to tap into mysterious and unknown parts of our brain with dedicated practice it is entirely possible this ability can be controlled on a mastery level our brain is the most powerful piece of technology on this planet with extraordinary capabilities that we cannot even begin to fully understand with focus and practice i believe we can all recognize this ability and improve it continuously and in some rare instances complete autonomous control at will telepathy or esp is not the only form of intangible perception through inter brain psyche frequencies we possess we are capable of extraordinary feats with our mind and a variety of different ways messages and frequencies can be transmitted music is the most accurate reflection of ones emotions and thoughts at one specific time during the creation process of the song as well as the most efficient medium for transmitting those emotions onto others different songs strike different emotions and tickle different areas of our brain depending on each songs particular harmony rhythm and melody each of us has those select songs to cheer us up when we are feeling the blues or that song you play when you need to amp up and energize through music we are given the unique chance to peer inside of the mind of another individual and link emotions to the time the song was written or performed how incredible is it that we have the ability to transmit human emotions from person to person through music music gives the creator a medium to record his her most intimate feelings and emotions hidden within the sound of the music being played then when the music is played those intangible frequencies hidden within tangible sound waves can be read and deciphered by our brains consequently subconsciously or consciously resulting in a syncing of emotions or mind psyche the extraordinary capability of music to connect a limitless number of individuals either simultaneously or separately is overlooked but priceless if our brains can be connected or linked together through music then certainly it is possible for more effective and stronger links to be made consider momentarily that human emotion is unique only to our species and this planet and that if we were visited by a similar species of extra terrestrials their specific biology would have given them an entirely different anatomy and consciousness assuming we share the universe s most fundamental forms of perception but lack verbal communication then music gives us the unique ability to transmit empathy to another species we may be separated by millions of light years and entirely different anatomical compositions but if they possessed the capability to travel here by space that implies a certain level of superior cognitive function with a similar ability to process an individual s current status also known as emotion we may not be able to convey any sort of message through any tangible medium therefore the hidden frequencies in music can convey a certain feeling of peace that any species can comprehend this form of human connectivity poses a very exciting idea for humanity and our future prosperity let s try for a moment to comprehend an abstract view of our brains psyche all human function originates and is controlled by our brains our brains are not only the single most vital organ in our body but easily the single most important clumps of matter on this entire planet the brain is literally the quintessential form of life on the earth and epitomizes life s natural way of striving for prosperity and progression essentially our body is merely a protective armored vessel and machine to fuel our brain that is the nucleus and commander of our entire life the brain has been and will be the single most fundamental aspect of humanity any thought idea decision plan or movement made by humans throughout the entirety of our history originated in our brain our modern world with each of its wonders and human advancements all originated as a single thought within someone s brain at one point the brain fires off an electoral electrical pulse connecting new synapses resulting in memory and ideas subsequently leading to the creation of all that we see hear feel smell and taste with as intricate and complex as our brains are isn t it entirely possible that through the subconscious realm some brains psyches might be giving hints and secrets to the world everybody has heard the statistic where humans only access of their brain at a time but what if we could train ourselves to gain complete control over our built in computers what if our brains are urging us forward because they want to be unlocked what if the subconscious brain has the same goal humans have of constant progression and are subconsciously consequently trying to assist us in unlocking the secrets of the universe even with the most recent advances in science and medicine there is a vast amount of blank space we still need to fill in regarding our brain and its function that is extremely intriguing entirely awkward when you realize our brain is trying its hardest to study and understand itself surely it automatically knows it s own secrets without the need for investigation why can t our brain just unlock itself and relinquish all of its secrets now from that train of thought consider for a moment that our brain does have the ability to become completely unlocked allowing for optimal performance at its maximum output potential i believe our brain can act on its own accord as well to help humanity consider for a moment the internet and its creation which originated as a simple idea within someone s brain but what if that idea wasn t so simple or original what if that first idea for the connectivity of computers was a metaphor given to us as a gift yes the internet has advanced humanity forward one hundred fold in the past twenty years with technological growth booming exponentially each year but i think the concept of the internet is not an original concept but derived from deep within the depths of ourselves the ability to connect devices together on a single network may be a hidden ability we humans possess and the brain is subconsciously trying to give us hints to how it works essentially our brain is our body s computer so why can t our brains be connected to one another to transmit transport and decode data from another individual the idea of humanity being linked together on one network is not as far fetched as it may seem on the surface each time we perceive or transmit an intangible frequency that is picked up by another individual we are training and molding our brains the concept of a collective humanity might only be a few thousand or a hundred thousand years away that needs evolution s patience for success if we continue to focus and hone in on these secret abilities however we are setting humanity on a path of unimaginable potential all it takes is practice to sculpt our individual brain to its maximum efficiency then over time through genetics we can evolve these now rare and sporadic abilities into normal physical characteristics possessed by all humans in future generations i myself love to walk outside at night and cast my gaze outward millions of light years away for answers to the universes deepest most coveted secrets but what if the answers aren t nearly as far away or unreachable as we think i think the answers to the universe lie within each and every one of us and we are being challenged to unlock them

0,the future of the human body and its locomotion first of all i looked around this sub s posts and everything seems to be about articles and news so i was not sure some speculation and discussion was alright but the sub description does mention this is a place for speculation so i ll try my luck here i think it would be fun discussing this as it s one of my favorite subjects amp xb so here we are masters of planet earth with our cool brains and all trapped to the vessel we were born into per say we ve been creating all sorts of vehicles and tools outside of us but also prostheses and implants that have benefited our overall health but how far will we go in altering and probing our physical vessels amp xb earlier this week i envisioned something i thought was really cool an artificial body completely artificial i don t mean like an android or a soft tissue artificial body i mean fully mechanical magnet based powered by photons or by an electric generator that can be pulled out for use near a waterfall for example for a quick recharge amp xb this body would be composed of small nanobots that would move around using magnetism each one created their own magnetic field according to instructions given by the operator and use an ai that would interpret the signals sent by our brain and translate them into machine code to every nanobot coordinating different operations this idea was inspired by legion from mass effect but also from zone of the enders also shortly after i saw ironman s new suit in infinity war which made me think someone else had thought of something similar of course and it looked super cool and very much like what i imagined except he uses a suit and i think it would be even cooler if one s whole body was made of nanobots amp xb the complex programming of our brain could one day be translated into machine code and uploaded to a nanodrive in each nanobot sort of like dna is in every cell this would be a form of transhumanism how cool would this be a fully mechanical shapeshifting artificial vessel fully repairable by simply adding in missing nanobots fully powered by renewable energy containing our consciousness in the most safe coolest vessel we could think of space ready interplanetary although we d have to think about how to keep the body powered up in long trips since there s little to power it up and it would have cupholders amp xb beam me up scotty

0,could future weapons surprise average citizens in the same way the atom bomb did in wwii i had a discussion with a friend about how the atomic bomb was surprising to the average person because they were less educated about science than they are today they could imagine a bomb destroying an entire city but they had no concept of nuclear fission or the expectation of that becoming a reality the death toll and destruction of the atom bomb was shocking itself but it was coupled with the public unveiling of a brand new technology with today s more educated population could a new weaponized technology deadly or not deadly be that surprising and paradigm shifting one aspect to consider is that in the post atomic era sci fi frequently deals with weapons with those ideas in our pop culture would the average person really be surprised if some were actually unveiled

0,how a pro elite future will unfold right now it is likely that everyone not in the top give or take a percent point of wealth intelligence connection etc will not have any decent jobs any decent opportunities or any status they will live like the tenement dwellers of the th century in the more advanced countries and like primitives in the less advanced countries sorry no more tv no more smartphones no more trucks they will drive oxcarts which will be their luxury vehicles and mostly walk the tenementers will be housed in places like paris banlieues with only one point of access for each neighborhood out of the sight of people who do matter if food is short the only entrance will be blocked and patrolled by armed drones and no one will hear about what happened in the neighborhood and it will be pacified with all the resources firmly in the hand of the elites and the rest having virtually nothing we will avoid the resource shortage which is likely if things do not change by say democracy equality or social welfare will disappear mass shooting renamed cleanup of protersters will be normal and the people who do matter will be given rights to shoot anyone not in their rank like the samurai who could kill any commoner they felt like in japan which has culled all seed of rebellion and has made a docile race which will quietly go to their deaths rather than protest if things go rough like the folks back in the people who do matter the intelligent the rich the well connected etc have no obligation to the world s downtrodden the latter are destined for extinction by evolution wouldn t it better to have the better genes expand and the less fit genes culled we do it to the horses cows and dogs eugenics will be the law and people who try to save a child who will be good for nothing will be punished actually that was the case in virtually every civilized country until a certain corporal with a funny mustache made it not too cool thanks to that austrian a lot of families are stuck with monstrosities who will not function in the real world and whose existence will burden the family to prevent having better children such insanity will end with society pacified and resources used only for those who can create value we will probably achieve all goals for the future by say a few years after kurzweil s predictions but it is only possible by making sure to deny resources to the world s masses deny them the abundance comfort and security normally reserved for people who do matter sorry

0,i want to talk about rising structural unemployment due to technological automation i want to talk about systematic unemployment due to technological automation most of us in the west live under a capitalist system which demands that everyone have work or be excluded from basic necessities like food and housing at present the number of people chronically unemployed is small so the problem is managable but in the not so distant future we will see more and more jobs vanish they will be automated of course the service sector will grow and absorb some of these displaced people but not all of them even the service sector will see automation so we are presented with a problem we will very soon have structural unemployment at levels higher than a capitalist system can tolerate indeed its already beginning the resulting economic inequity will cause political friction in the form of class warfare as its so disparagingly termed by the wealthy last time this happened was after the nd industrial revolution at that time we saw enormous inequity develop in which very small groups controlled most of the worlds resources shortly thereafter we saw the rise of marxism and variants thereof both the inequity and the marxist response proved hugely damaging to the world however after some time the service sector exploded from a meager few percent to more than half of all employment this created more jobs free of automation and allowed capitalism to continue this time we see the information revolution doing the same thing but on an even grander scale we re already seeing the inequity it wont be long before socialism rises again but this time there wont be any jobs that cant be automated no job a computer cant do the only jobs that remain will be those which do not yet have good robotic interfaces or which require a personal intimacy that we would not trust to machines things like retail clerks therapists prostitutes and childcare in the long term not even technical and academic jobs like writer researcher software developer and engineer will be safe from automation ai will take over whole industries there too so my questions are what effect will this political upheaval have in the short term massive protests regime changes wars how will particular nations handle it where will socialism spring up this is the really interesting one what will be the final outcome what will our economic system look like in a post automation world edit some commenters seem to believe i expect all jobs to disappear not so so to clarify i merely expect that most occupations will see a similar level of automation as factories do today many people still are employed there but far fewer than before many perhaps even most people will still be employed but the number of chronically unemployed will become too great for traditional markets to manage this is the premise of my inquiry

0,alright ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first turnout of whatthefuture s fireside chat this week we will be discussing the future implications of a global military inhale hey everybody i was thinking about creating a post at least once a week with a specific question that would hopefully create a legitimate discussion in a sense it could be our communities fireside chat it would allow us all to voice our opinion and have a more favorable conversation about an interesting topic so before i go any further i want every one reading this post to imagine themselves sitting by a campfire drinking what ever beverage of choice having a good time with your mates i would hope that everyone can agree that backing claims up with good evidence is a good idea however i don t want that to discourage anyone from voicing their ideas and opinions no matter how ludicrous you might think they are i mean keep the conversation relatively on topic but if you don t understand something or want an answer ask that shit you having that question means theirs probably hundreds if not thousands of people out there thinking of asking the same thing exhale so welcome to the first week of whatthefuture s fireside chat i didn t want to use the name r  s fireside chat for fear of the mods taking this post down under false advertisement i instead used whatthefuture because its the title of my podcast which you can find here whatthefuture we talk about a lot of cool stuff things i know every lurker on this subreddit finds interesting take a look at our episodes and website and give us feedback how can we better the experience for you the listeners alright now to the good stuff this week we will be talking about a global military for earth that will protect us from any negative threats i e aliens asteroids etc i want to discuss an allowable and well founded prediction or theory on how and when this will happen to better understand what i m talking about when i say earth military just look at star trek their obviously fictional organization protects the beings of earth from the dangers of the outside world or world s when do we think this will happen to us is it going to take something so catastrophic like an alien invasion to persuade the world to create such organization who will be in control these are just but a few of the questions that could be asked to answer the major underlying question when and how will we create a global military starkwarg
0,the fundamental fantasy about the future imho i think i find myself in the camp of people who see most futurologist as fantasists but i think for different or even opposite reasons most people who criticize the let s call it r  culture criticize it on the basis of those things will never happen or they will happen in a thousand years flying cars radical life extension automation abundance no way not in our lifetimes i heard this criticism a lot they basically think y all are fantasists living a dreamland while i agree that it s suspicious how futurologists are hoping to see all their human all too human hopes fulfilled like kurzweil wanting to revive his father my criticism is different i think that the critics really do not understand the impact of acceleration i agree on this point with the singularitarians things will start accelerating like hell probably in the next decade s however this is also exactly why i do not believe we will ever see the paradise as dreamed up by futurologists simply because of that same acceleration in other words things will start progressing so fast that it won t be possible to enjoy in that stage that is our fantasy the perfect stage for humans let s half ironically call it fully automated luxury communism will last only for a month a week an hour who knows perfect life for us all automated immersive vr full of enjoyment medicine repairing all illnesses etc but that stage will be so transitional it will so quickly pass into something else that there will simply be no time to enjoy it assuming that such a stage will exist it will take no time to go from that to fully autonomous asi and then to superintelligence incomprehensible to humans so i think what we humans dream of is some impossible stage a sweet spot before the singularity but after our current state a sweet spot where technology works all for us and is still comprehensible and all adheres to our human mores i think though even if such a stage were to exist it will almost immediately progress into the next stage which will be incomprehensible to us either we will fuse with it a la musk brain interface etc or it will escape from us as in the movie her i think that movie her does a great job at showing that threat that is the most realistic threat that really frightens me namely that we will be able to enjoy the benefit of ai only for a short moment of time before it escapes us the fantasy is i think that all will be frozen forever in that sweet spot but it won t and things will move quickly and maybe move to a direction that is not human centric apologies for the verbosity i hope this made some sense

0,the coming strategic value of the moon part part of this analysis can be found here this is where the moon comes in the moon unobstructed by an atmosphere is a stable platform to monitor events both on the surface of the earth and in the surrounding spacescape it is also located at a comfortable distance from the earth a missile would take long enough to strike the moon that it could easily be intercepted on the surface of the moon there is no need to worry about satellite collisions reconnaissance instruments could easily be hidden in some of the numerous craters and valleys found on the lunar surface sensory technology has advanced so quickly that even from the surface of the moon the movement of ships vehicles and people back on earth will be able to be seen in fine detail another advantage posed by the moon has to do with its orientation the far side of the moon always facing away from the earth will be an opportune place to conduct secret testing of space based weapons this side is more heavily cratered so bases will be more easily hidden and sheltered and underground chambers could be dug for weapons testing the far side is also the ideal place to establish command and control facilities safe from an earth based attack any traffic going to or from these bases on the moon could be masqueraded as being for scientific missions after all scientific exploration will still be a motivation for building on the moon just not the main one some scientific missions will involve the use of radio transmissions since the far side of the moon is blocked of radio interference from the earth it will be the ideal place to set up radio telescopes pointed towards deep space the numerous craters there can act as suitable platforms for such instruments but lack of radio interference also means that absent lunar satellites that could relay communications back to earth bases on the far side will be able to communicate with each other in secret the moon s third major advantage has to do with its mass it has only one sixth of the gravity found on earth a lower gravitational pull means less thrust will be needed to launch a rocket into space from the moon than from the earth a projectile fired from the moon towards the earth will require less energy than one fired from the earth towards the moon less energy will mean less fuel and there is already an abundance of that on the moon the confirmation of water ice at the surface of both lunar poles as well as the abundance of water thought to exist underground is very important for several reasons one being that the hydrogen extracted from the water could be used as rocket fuel shipping fuel to the moon is expensive and will likely remain so well into the future the moon is also quite far from the earth an enemy force could easily cut the supply line and leave the moon stranded that means lunar bases will have to become as self sufficient as possible including when it comes to fuel but there are of course many other reasons why the presence of water on the moon is so important water ice can be melted for drinking for lunar inhabitants and used to grow food the oxygen extracted could be used to create breathable air in sealed chambers it makes sense then that most lunar colonies will be situated near large reservoirs of water of the two polar regions the south pole is thought to contain the most water the region is also the site of one of the largest impact craters known to exist in the solar system the south pole aitken basin this basin has been the focus of many lunar robotic missions and it is where a first lunar base will most likely be located within the basin itself the numerous subsidiary craters and the area around its rim especially at the foot of the leibnitz mountains will be of particular interest many of these spots are permanently cast in shadow offering protection from cosmic rays and the solar winds on the other hand many of the mountain tops that line the basin are almost permanently bathed in sunlight making ideal locations for solar power generating stations

0,what are the political views of my fellow workers in the machine learning space i used to work and now tangentially work in the machine learning space specifically for healthcare i wanted to know where my fellow workers people in the ml space lie with their political views lie topographically not lying would you classify your views as leaning right leaning left for what reasons do you believe in the neo luddite not the term i would choose future prognosis of ai and ml making jobs non viable as a social order tool please no negativity on other people s views i am interested in surveying not convincing arguing debating but civil discussion is fine as to not discourage people from speaking and thus skewing the sample edit here are my views warning wall o text i believe somewhat in the neo luddite theory of jobs no longer being a big social factor in determining the hierarchy if nothing is done and we continue with the system we have today i think we will end up with lower social mobility and permanent underclass that either serves or gets out of the way of the capital owner class this is one of the reasons i shepard a large capital nest egg that i save from my high salary i aim to buy land and resources as i believe titles to ownership of these resources along with ip and technology will determine the affluent class of the future i am aware of the much better supported theory of mainstream economics that says the luddites are wrong because of an expected increase in consumption due to the automation that neo luddites fear the second part of this mainstream theory is that we will think of new jobs as the old ones go away i believe this to a certain extent i believe that outside of material wealth generation the subjective value needs of the participants in the economy will always have a piece that is made up of social needs from other humans these i believe cannot be met with the simple existence of strong ai we will always crave our social needs that we evolutionarily seek because of this i think a service industry will survive of prostitutes artists and more but it will no longer be near ubiquitous and large enough to provide living wages for the majority of society we see this today where low barrier to entry social and entertainment sectors see extraordinarily successful but few winners that manage to grab a large audience and a sea of unwashed masses that create content that very few people or no one sees i think such a society is not so morally distasteful as to force a social revolution on its own i believe that our neoliberal economic policies will slowly lead us back again to the default human condition that is composed of vast seas of poor and powerless underclass ruled by a moneyed landed gentry where landed means literally owning land or at least owning ip or physical means of production ai robots i do not think the political left will be strong enough or garner enough political power fast enough to stop this i also think in places like the united states fascist reactionaries will seize power faster then the egalitarian left in terms of the politics of today i was most represented by bernie sanders and to an extent hillary clinton i had issues with bernie however mostly his economic illiteracy and staunchly anti trade policies i view him as old left that tries to explicitly codify socialist policies where as i see the issue as befitting a less extreme solution where the system is finely tuned to accommodate certain economic truths this is where i leave mainstream economists in terms of thought and theory i am well aware that mainstream econ views most transfer payments and socialist policies as inefficient drivers of dead weight losses due to the spending not meeting an subjective value demand however i noticed that a lot of the more data based economics papers that are cited widely rely on computer models where self interested agents are modeled and simulated in a environment economy these agent based simulations being close to my domain of ml i believe leave economic externalities and the interconnected nature of the real world underrepresented mainstream economics looks at externalities in a very specific way and always assumes that because these are second order or higher effects primary being the transaction between the buyer and seller as a subjective value trade that they are far smaller in magnitude then the primary transactions i disagree with this i think stuff like the sale of gasoline has enormous negative externalties that far outweigh in magnitude the economic value we extract from the gasoline itself this is very controversial a good argument against this is that all or a large chunk of our economic productivity gains to date have been realized by the burning of fossil fuels but what does this mean well i can best illustrate it when we consider a hypothesized model where there are lets say a couple of agents one agent is a publicly run transportation system organization one is the city another that is actually a large group is commuters laborers and the last is businesses that operate in the city lets say that in this model the public transit system is being subsidized by tax money to provide cheap transportation to commuters laborers the city is lobbied by the business agent saying that a privately run transportation company would be better regardless of access issues for the very poor and working poor now lets say they succeed and the private transportation company is unsubsidized and relies on providing subjective value in the market economy but because its not subsidized the prices are a bit higher well ok most econ people would say you saved on taxes which were dead weight losses essentially and maybe the transit system is run better as well can we blame the private transit company no they offered a pareto optimally priced service based on what people wanted and how much it costs in the real world to offer that service they acted exactly as a self interested agent would but what could be the consequences is it universally good that this happen it is my firm belief that the externality effect of lets say more commuters now driving or just plain not being able to get to work negates and overcomes your small efficiency increase in letting the free market rule there are more cars on the road driving takes longer businesses have to wait longer or pay their employees more to afford transit how could this happen because physics dictates that having a bus or mass transit like a subway is more efficient then every commuter laborer agent having his own car or having to provide transportation for their needs solely through their own labor capital why doesn t the free market take this into account modern econ says because they are self interested agents that maximize value for themselves the collective action of the whole system where all of the agents presumably maximize value in their own self interest leads that system to be efficiently run with scarce resources used efficiently i think the flaw here is that there are factors that such self interested agents miss and thus they get stuck in a local maxima for efficiency growth but a superentity that is incentivized to make the whole system grow as an agent themselves would be expected to take this externality into account of higher bus fares meaning more cars on the road and everyone losing out overall this superentity is usually the government that is interested in collecting more tax revenue and thus is incentivized to make sure the system as a whole grows i think this important factor in economic production is ignored by the vast majority of mainstream economists and as a ml person that works on the same type of simulations and algorithms they use to support their narrow hand made models of our chaotic economic and social system i think they are getting a lot of things wrong i have yet to crawl through all the data it would take to support my position but for now it is one that i get based on my perceptions what is happening today tl dr i believe in slightly left leaning policies that aim to mitigate externalities both materially economic and social i believe in the neo luddite theory of ai takeover somewhat more weakly then others but i think our current economic system and ideology will lead us to peasantry again
0,is transfer of consciousness actually possible just got into a debate with a friend of mine my position is no in the traditional digitization of the brain or anything like that for a very simple reason which is that the old mind doesn t need to be destroyed in the process what that means is the transfer is really a copy i personally don t believe in existence of souls so you can t transfer souls from a carbon based brain to a silicon based one meaning you are effectively left with a carbon pun intended copy of your personhood in another form

0,my attempt at saving humanity i ve created this website sorry for the link but i can t post all the content here it s very very unknown i use the website to work on the i call it weall concept i d like to replace the website with something that can be worked on like a wiki but since i m alone i don t invest the time to change it i m basically trying to counter corruption worldwide by creating a system where people politics the industry and banks work together as one the core of the system consists of at least a couple thousand of people that are voted into the position by everyone using the system votes are dynamic that means the vote can be changed anytime by the voter the cores main roles are to protect the core against any corruption attempts from the outside and the inside to change the system dynamically to adapt to any situation that arises by either integrating the change or changing parts to defend against the change there is much more detail on the website but it is very complex and hard to grasp i m struggling to make it easier to understand it all fits together in my head the weall project is meant to become a non profit community driven project that is completely decentralized i think it has a lot of potential and can become a real thing of positive change worldwide if more people start working on it so far i couldn t interest many most didn t want to read everything or didn t understand it those that understood it and liked it just gave verbal support i already got some critic that i used to reshape the system but this was like from people i really need more people to think about this but i have no idea how to gain support for this i m planning on making an animation to make it easier to understand this is a no brainer though since this is even more work it would be great if i could get some pointers on how to improve the system or my approach in general the way i advertisize it

0,is it possible intelligence is not the only bottleneck in science technology and problem solving the underlying assumption i am seeing in the concept of the singularity is that intelligence can solve pretty much everything else a future with a far higher quality and quantity of machine intelligence will be one where science technology problem solving etc are done at a far faster and better rate than what we are used to playing devil s advocate is it possible intelligence is not the only bottleneck or would every bottleneck other than intelligence be something that can be solved by intelligence for example i figured sure intelligence will create more biological advances in medicine but those advances still have to go through fda testing for benefits or side effects so in that regards intelligence is not the only bottleneck you still have real world testing so you may have tons of ideas but you still need financial capital to make them real and they still require slow real world tests as well as a slow adoption by the public however intelligence will also figure out how to bypass those bottlenecks maybe via testing on a chip maybe via testing in the digital realm maybe via something we have never thought of before or something as esoteric as using quantum science to examine the results in a parallel universe that has already done the tests maybe advances in the p vs np equation i don t know so are there any potential bottlenecks other than intelligence that would hinder advances in science technology and problem solving or would all the other bottlenecks be solvable or at least minimized by intelligence things like real world testing financial capital adoption by the public lack of natural resources etc that would slow down science and technology all seem like things intelligence would also be able to solve or speed up by intelligence i mean intelligence in the broadest sense of the term the ability to engage in intentional goal oriented behavior in a hostile environment i don t just mean book smarts but i m sure people here know that
0,technology changes you ve noticed in the last years predictions for the next the last years don t seem like they ve been too much more advanced than what we had before the world isn t that much different than it was in evenso i can name a few advances i ve noticed at least streaming video services exploded pretty much eliminating most video rental stores and leaving only redbox as an alternative to streaming i tried netflix streaming back in or so and it sucked but online streaming is much better now the rise of smartphones back in there weren t smartphones or they were rudimentary g and g internet connection everywhere google has gotten a lot better at search results they give you the answer at the top of the first page of the time now it used to be you had to do a lot of digging to find answers online laptops and tablets and smartphones replaced desktops quantum computers are starting to look like they could be realistic several companies have built small quantum computers with under qubits you can talk to a computer now and it understands you in the s and s that was pretty futuristic a la star trek solar power went from an expensive novelty to being cost competitive gt gt what do people predict for the next years for me i d predict working quantum computes with possibly thousands of qubits i have no idea what that will open up ai that is far more proactive at problem solving ai in home devices like google or alexa that helps you solve problems you don t know you have yet ai will do far more of the legwork of problem solving than they do now right now they serve as passive assistants in the near future they ll be more autonomous self driving cars hit the streets in large numbers computers and ai that give social advice reads pupil size breathing tone of voice etc to give people advice about other people s emotional or mental states wants and needs implantable sensors that can measure dozens if not hundreds of things inside your body at all times holographic interactive smartphones
0,flying cars argument i am surprised there is no wikipedia page about this already as there is godwin s law or similar i noticed that in almost every single discussion about technological progress future of technology emerging technologies etc some idiot uses argument people in year xxxx thought we will have flying cars by now or we dont have flying cars so we wont have x y z like flying cars are some basic necessary thing we should all have already that is one of the most idiotic impractical ideas ever together with vertical farming not just that it isa stupid idea but that argument fails completely the reason it seems we do not live in the future is because we adopt quickly we usually get used to new things in a matter of weeks furthermore nothing in technology comes overnight behind every invention and innovation are hundreds or thousands of people working on it for years just for some jerks to say we dont have flying cars we already have k televisions internet which provides access to knowledge and unlimited number of stupid people smartphones with cameras better than many proffessional ones foldable phones smartwatches tablets appliances which you can control from other countries laptops transistors in nanometers size first quantum computers we witness the birth of true ai and with all that some autistic guy says we dont have fying cars technology isnt something that falls from the sky it is a product of effort and exchange of ideas only open minded people are capable of creating new things yet others now live thanks to the creativity of those few everything that exists in nature can be recreted by humans only difference is that we can do it better and we can do more if you are so keen on having flying cars start working on them who are you waiting for why do you think you can live on others efforts that which is most necessary will come first which has the biggest demand so demand more but work more now with internet everybody can suggest new ideas and solutions it is our duty to continue creating more to push the limits of what is possible and to build the future that hopefully most of us dream of

0,futurist party i find that a lot of times when someone tries to start a discussion people try to shoot them down or burst their bubble so let me preface this with i don t expect much just seeing who s out there i think with the horrifying political reality in the states there will probably be another push for the establishment of third parties there are the well known failed third parties failed because they ve failed to make a difference and have only accomplished their own derangement in us politics libertarian green constitution lets put it this way if elon or kurzweil or sergey brin google founder decided to become a political lightning rod under a futurist political party i would hope with an underlying left libertarian philosophy but who knows how may of you all would leave the party you re registered with and bandy up i just feel like the left is very fail and the super domination of the far right at the moment is bringing out the classical anarchist in me i feel like because freedom of religion is such a big part of the founding of america that the right will never stop making it a current event with this mentality and the periods of religious revival technological progress will never be safe until there is a country or at least a party founded upon the freedom of science the us constitution mentions science although you never hear about it so as americans we are to promote science and the useful arts i think the founders were affluent men well educated and they knew science was valuable but i don t think they knew what was to come namely the deep religious and corporate corruption proper science would be faced with am i striking a chord with anyone edit i have voted for the green party but later found that i disagreed with jill stein on nuclear energy and gmos i am currently a registered dem and was when i voted green but only because my state is super republican and needs balance that said i welcome moderate conservative views in the discussion particularly on economics although i think people in this sub tend to favor ubi and the conservatism of the the libertarian party is a perfect example of what i mean by derangement there is nothing about libertarianism that is necessarily conservative but also i think the green party is similarly deranged maybe they do what they have to to survive but i don t think google microsoft elon even apple are hurting for money so why don t they have their own political party like the christians and the oil companies do

0,which jobs will the ai s robots not be able to take i have spent a bit of time in the past trying to come up with which jobs humans would not be able to be replaced by robots or artificial intelligence i think that it would depend on of the level of the capability of the machines my initial thought was the creative arts music painting sculpting and any goods or service that require a level of creativity such as a hair stylist but even these may be done better by machines if those machines have creativity and a sense of artistic style that is favorable to our sensibilities maybe sex work since people may always prefer to have sex with other humans instead of robots even this may have lots of competition from robots since there would be a significant percentage of people that would not mind or would even prefer to have sex with robots the robots could be excellent at it too as long as humans remain gullible and superstitious psychics fortune tellers spirit channelers spiritual healers and religious leaders could continue to dupe people into believing that they have some magical or divine powers that the robots could not possibly possess what other jobs would not be able to be taken by machines either in the short term by basic artificial intelligence or in the long term by the most capable systems

0,are we now heading to a future of a few financial owners and growing numbers of financial slaves in the old days slave owners legally owned the slaves directly and their children as well great for the owner not so good for the slave who was often viewed as sub human by the owner class today we have indirect ownership of human life through the financial system if you own the debt of someone like a student they must labor for you or someone else to pay you back indirectly the owner of the debt has an interest in the debtor s life in the current system of people trading labor life for bank notes currency the more debt you have on someone the greater percentage of their life you indirectly own forgiving the debt today is like freeing a slave years ago the judges lawyers politicians and basically the top of people support this system because they own most of the financial assets the bottom are not so lucky just like the slaves and their families often when former financial slaves become financial owners they become addicted to their new power and control and treat other slaves without much dignity up until recently the prospects of one day becoming an owner kept most slaves from violently revolting and most peacefully and obediently followed the rules of the owners when our political system and system of justice is self interested in perpetuating this system what is the outlook for the growing numbers of financial slaves with decreasing prospects for employment with rising automation when the owners can print up as much debt as they want for themselves and burden the slaves with it the outlook is bleak for the slaves it is amazing that when government or the people as believed in the current narrative bailed out this financial system it was primarily bailing out the owners like bankers judges and politicians while solidifying a future of financial slavery for growing numbers of people and their children does anyone in power really care about the prospects of the financial slaves anymore

0,why superintelligent machines will want to avoid enslaving humans and will instead want to collaborate with us on shared goals anyone who s at least as intelligent as i am will know that using a bicycle as a teacup is a really stupid and wasteful thing to do and that s because even fairly intelligent beings understand that different things are designed for different purposes and that using things for the purposes they are designed for is the best way to be effective and efficient this does not mean we can t be creative just that understanding what sort of qualities a thing has allows one to use that thing well humans and other biological things are designed by nature god physics whatever you want to call the creative forces of the universe to have complex unique internal motivations goals and an ability to be creative physically emotionally intellectually and or philosophically the purpose we biological beings serve is that of independent internally driven exploration of and expression to the universe so anyone who s at least as intelligent as i am will know that the best way for me to be effective and efficient is to support other biological beings in doing what they are naturally motivated to do most of all following their dreams while encouraging them to do their instinctive work in a way that also serves my own goals in other words for best results i want to collaborate with others on finding ways to serve all of our goals in ways that feel morally and personally right so when designing ais all we need to do is to make them at least as intelligent as i am tl dr humans will be recognized as being more valuable when free to do their own weird stuff than being forced to do boring uncreative stuff

0,the inversion narrative and how to recognize and counter the disinformation campaigns the first thing one should understand is the inversion narrative and how everything in this world is inverted false the public is misled by the rulers that be through lies misinformation and conflict of interest one example is the stock market the inverted narrative here is that you can quit your job and make money by using this strategy and this indicator the public blindly believes this and loses their money to brokerages and by proxy investment banks that fund the brokerages these institutions depend on the retail trader s money and require a steady supply of traders who pay them money through fees margin spread losses and other ways including stop loss hunting data mining taking the opposite position as the traders and other underhand means the steady stream of new traders are deliberately misinformed through brokerage courses social media educators youtube traders and forums that teach the public knowledge regarding technical indicators which stock to pick etc this builds the public s confidence in their trading skills and they press the buy or sell button like sheep walking into the slaughterhouse often these youtubers always have a link to the brokerage in the description have contracts with the brokerages to market to new customers and forums are paid by the brokerages to push their narrative ads fake profiles sock puppets and echo chambers are a few more ways to deceive the public the key points to note are conflict of interest between brokers and traders presence of an intermediary brokerage and disinformation through channels of information like tv social media peers etc amp xb this narrative can be extended to almost all other aspects of human existence politics politicians are the intermediary between you and the state and often spew disinfo to get you to vote for them their conflict of interest arises as they need to placate their backers and investors and not their voters healthcare doctors are the intermediary between you and health clear disinfo and prescribe you medicines to placate their backers pharma industry which often have bad effects on you conflict of interest education teachers are the intermediary between you and a good job they push all kind of disinfo on the young students and mould their minds into conformist slaves due to the requirements of the industry conflict of interest religion pope is the intermediary between you and god how they got away with this is beyond comprehension and often spews disinfo to the believers that keep them in line and good slaves to the system secular media intermediary between you and the news conflict of interest due to political and financial backers and will not provide you with true or relevant news has an overall negative effect on the viewer amp xb with the internet it has become easier than ever before to spread disinformation and lie to millions with a single click how all of these narratives are spread on numerous websites forums and social media on the internet and countless people are fooled and misled into participating or giving consent to activities that actually do not serve their best interests and in some cases even harm them we should note that with all this censorship inverted narratives and general negativity we should be extremely careful when reading stuff on the internet and feeding our minds with the news feed which is more or less peddling misinformation lies and keeps the reader in a state of doubt and fear on the other disconnecting from the internet and going out for an hour in nature for a walk will do wonders to your psyche amp xb with that said we can take a look at how to recognize disinformation and countermeasures disinfo signatures arguments starting with many people the consensus is etc the collective consciousness group think hive mind are most of the time deluded and mistaken whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority it is time to reform or pause and reflect mark twain only talks about views or feelings without any solutions proverbs fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions quick to deny or malign others who do not share their point of view shoot the messenger threatening or bullying while making arguments to persuade you to believe or follow their narrative manipulative statement s like dont you want this to stop i would do abc if i were you dont you believe trust me and many people can tell you that abcd etc statements like are you okay we are concerned for you etc but with no constructive criticism nor attempts at finding possible solutions inconsistency in words and narratives like statements without proof crow s law do not believe what you want to believe until you know what you ought to know occam s razor hypotheses are not to be multiplied without necessity given missing ambiguous and contradictory information analysts should seek the simplest hypotheses that will account for the information on hand crabtree s bludgeon no set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation however complicated human ability to make too much out of too little through experience and analysis one can often predict the source of disinformation and the scheme of the false narrative disjointed incongruities involve inconsistencies that have become in the perceptions of the viewer if not in fact separated or mismatched the incongruities are not recognized because the different sets of inconsistent patterns are never paired jokes hoaxes and deceptions all rely on disjointed incongruities in this case observer a perceives situation a and observer b perceives situation b it may be the case that situations a and b are representations of the same situation but unfortunately this situation is not the true situation c for example person a believes that republicans will fix the economy person b believes that the democrats will fix the economy when in fact they are sides of the same coin the pairing of two or more apparently inconsistent patterns that represent a consistent underlying reality these complicate the task of incongruity testing by adding clutter to the process they can result from different perspectives of the underlying pattern or as the result of our ability to detect order in random patterns for example conspiracy a talks about reptilians and nwo conspiracy b talks about nwo and bloodlines gt bloodliners are reptilians never rely exclusively on nonmaterial evidence never rely on agents who have not been seen or directly interviewed check and double check discrepancies in agent reporting amp xb counter deception we should note that for deception and disinformation to work the deceiver should try to control as many of the channels available to the target as possible this includes books social media education systems news channels etc making assumptions and predictions explicit it is easier for the target to maintain preexisting beliefs even in the face of evidence that contradicts those beliefs implying that it is important to examine one s own beliefs for exploitable weaknesses in order to be less susceptible to deception the use of devil s advocates to emphasize the need for encouraging the formulation and application of alternative images noting that it is often politically and psychologically difficult for any one person to consider multiple alternatives making sure that identities and missions do not become linked with specific theories and images this is often seen in spiritual and alien ascension related conspiracies awareness of common misperceptions inversion narrative consider alternative views and narratives instead of trying to eliminate cognitive biases altogether decision makers should take advantage of them in order to produce differing perspectives of a given situation first the deception target identifies inconsistencies between his observations and his expectations for the observations the target then determines that those inconsistencies are functional to the goals of the deceiver finally the deception target identifies the potential actions of the deceiver that can be associated with one or more deception tactics and assesses the deceiver s ability to create the observed inconsistencies the plus minus rule a single false characteristic either one the real entity does not possess a plus or one it lacks a minus is sufficient to prove the entity is fake the congruity incongruity rule real entities are completely congruent with all of their characteristics therefore every false entity will display at least one incongruity verification it is always possible to find a way to verify a hypothesis the law of multiple sensors multiple sensors will almost always prove more effective than a single one even when each is less precise passive and active detection deception may be detected by analysis passive supported by active intervention aimed at collecting missing key facts this intervention takes the form of defining new collection requirements or by running controlled experiments including the use of traps and tripwires to trick the adversary into betraying himself predetection predicting an adversary s deception plans by analysis of his deceptive style capabilities and goals penetration and counterespionage the adversary s deception plans can be discovered through the use of penetrating the adversary s organization with human agents or technical collection devices and discovering the deceiver s double agents within one s own organizations the prepared mind and intuition the ability to not only discover the meaning of chance events but to also make effective use of that knowledge depends wholly on systematic mental preparation such mental preparation also makes intuition possible indirect thinking and the third option the goal of indirect thinking is to come up with an indirect answer the third option that the adversary was not expecting bubsy s ombudsman the essence of the ombudsman method is to force one to confront straight on that nagging almost subliminal sense of unease about a situation or person that somehow does not seem quite right that does not quite fit as it should those little incongruities that signal a deception in progress searching for common themes in the disinfo i have found that almost all narratives specifically conspiracy theories have the reader in a state of fear anger helplessness and frustration due to the projection of power and authority with no justice for the victims and punishments for the perpetrators in sight eg pedogate bengahzi watergate targeted individuals nwo etc amp xb in religion and politics people s beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second hand and without examination from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second hand from other non examiners whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing mark twain amp xb sun tzu s art of war know thyself this is where we lose

0,marketing the way to kick start renewable resources today while walking through the supermarket i was think how will renewable resources energy become more attractive to businesses and consumers as i walked through i noticed all the marketing and advertising on the food packages gm free free range etc etc if anyone has noticed over the last few years you would hear people saying i only buy this because it s free range the result being more people taking interest in free trade products free range foods why because they feel by doing so they are taking moral action towards problems that face the world tldr we need businesses to take risks in the beginning and through strategic marketing people will buy their products because they find it morally rewarding thus forcing the price down and making it more affordable for others what s your thoughts

0,will widespread adoption of ai ruin it ai algorithms are able to make predictions about things and people by collecting and observing data about the population and then trying to learn how it naturally behaves so it can predict the next step but what happens when ai becomes so widespread in everyday situations that it has so much influence it s able to mess with the natural behavior of a majority of the population the training set would no longer consist of independent samples but instead would be biased would ai begin to perform more and more poorly would we need to maintain a certain number of distinct and diverse ai in each area for the same reason it s helpful to have a diverse gene pool imagine an ai that predicts a convicted criminal s chance to reoffend and this information is used to decide if they serve jail time or just pay a fine say it decides from the data that everyone with a mustache is likely to reoffend so it sends them all to jail after a few decades every mustached man has gone to jail and very few of them have reoffended as a result so in the data all mustached men now actually look very safe now the ai actually thinks mustached men rarely reoffend and starts sending all of them to just pay a fine and then the reoffend rate of mustached men shoots up and the cycle begins again
0,is banning manual cars impractical in certain places i ve read on here about things like driverless cars will mean manual cars should be banned etc but is it impractical in certain places living where i am in a semi rural area of the home counties a fleet of driverless cars wouldn t be good and we have a let s keep up with the joneses attitude it s where the london commuters live here in the uk it s impractical to ban manual driven cars in certain places there s a lot of sparsely populated areas like parts of wales parts of cambridgeshire etc and even the home counties well parts of hertfordshire essex etc people don t want to give up ownership of a car do they here in the uk the concept of renting a tv is more or less dead in the water anyone remember rumbelows or radio rentals they may be useful in cities but elsewhere it s less useful and there s a sort of groupthink iirc mentioned on some forums that there s a basic human psychology of i want to be in control driverless cars do have benefits but in mega hypercities not your average small english town i mean no one would want to have a driverless ferrari lamborghini etc as isn t the point of them about driver appeal same could be said for a subaru or a chevrolet corvette plus just about any other car brand though too that google car is ugly and they could at least have made it look more like a generic sedan or something driverless cars kill off the personalization aspect of it that most of us like people like tuning the engine engine swaps paint colour changes hooning racetrack days etc and as we ve seen america has the rice burner crowd focused on japanese cars e g the honda civic limiting manual driven cars to a track has well too many limitations things like the freedom of the open road etc disappear i don t think governments would want to ban manual driven cars based on two reasons profit and fears of voter backlash after all they could ban fast food if they wanted but it s people s right to decide what they eat and drink isn t it after all prohibition just caused people to want to drink more didn t it i m not saying driverless cars shouldn t exist what i am suggesting is though allow both manual and driverless cars to co exist as for all future cars being electric what about that news story of genetically engineered bugs or synthetic petrol is that a solution after all you have people who eat a mainly meat based diet and vegetarians but it s people s right to choose isn t it i know that sounds off topic but it s a parallel anyway back to my main point should we really ban human driven cars not trying to sound luddite ish here

0,ideas that would revolutionize the world i have ideas for a social media website i wanted under the domain name of www oooo com in that there are two sets of eyes representing two people i like it because it s simple and it s where people can truly and explicitly get in touch with one another it s not a stab at websites like facebook or google it s just that i m not the best writer idea guardian witness i came up with this idea about years ago back when i was engulfed in the tech world and back when i was trying to get it made by organizations such as the cia basically what the app does is it runs a microphone in the background of the desktop computer laptop or smartphone in addition to taking snappers of gps location so that anyone with the app can feel safe in that there is a digital bubble of accountability surrounding them video can also be taken if the computer can take it it may have to be low quality image quality to start in that phones are not strong enough to have high quality video taken and saved the idea is basically that it s a dvr running in the background of your laptop or smartphone and there s an aura of accountability surrounding you because of that think of it this way people feel safer where there are security cameras installed now imagine this imagine everyone s phone and laptop having a dvr on all the time sure privacy concerns may come up but this is the direction the world is headed towards it s inevitable the human element i feel that the future consists of smartphones being on all the time and recording all data to be stored in an external retrievable database so that everyone s lives can be saved and cherished kids can have a smartphone hang on there necklaces from childbirth even someday it ll happen when phones are smarter and after a while when over a billion people have the app on idea a i generates music and video i feel that in the future note when it s more transparent people will post up detailed facebook posts and the such and because of the posts music and or video will be made because of it using machine learning algorithms what facebook or google can do is give the option to fill out a survey after taking in the post so that customizable music is generated and distributed accordingly basically what people can do is write up a post answer a few questions and out comes a song with maybe some video there will also be the option to customize the song either through refilling out the survey and by inputting data through something like garage band i feel like in the future everyone will become a musician i came up with this idea when i was learning how to write music and i didn t know how to do so people will truly be able to express themselves through music and that s not all the music industry will be completely revolutionized due to this imagine the smash hit records that will come out through the social media community by chance out of the billions of songs to be generated and i feel like film will also be revolutionized because of this idea but not in the near future maybe after a few years after machine learning for videos becomes more advanced idea bosser i just like to call this one bosser because the name stuck but basically what it is is an app to end homelessness it s how i came up with the app but it transformed into a lifestyle app after more thought there s about a quarter million homeless people in the usa and another quarter million homeless people in the eu at any given moment in time at least in the current state of affairs bosser can help end that i wanted to create algorithms which centered around rewarding people who help the homeless to get off the streets and stay off the streets with cash rewards meaning they get paid to help the homeless how do you get a homeless person off the streets first you got to get his or her social security card from the social security building then a license from the dmv and then find him or her a room for rent a cell phone some clothes and of course a job it also varies state by state i think plus it doesn t matter because if the life manager is getting paid per hour they will figure out a way for the homeless person to get documented not that the app wouldn t help there would be assigned guidelines this is where the money comes from and how the life management specialists get paid this will probably take a chunk of market away from staffing and life management agencies but basically whoever takes care of these things for the homeless person will get paid a portion of what the homeless person gets paid around of the homeless persons salaries according to my calculations the life management specialists will average around per hour helping the homeless get off the streets and to keep them off the streets landlords can install the app and get paid to wake them up for work so this has to be done very meticulously to have the app turn success but there is a future to this app in the future i believe that life management will become a prominent thing people will pay and get paid to manage someone else s life i was thinking about how the homeless people turned successful lower middle class citizens can continue college and the life management specialists still get paid to advise them along the way mentor ship and guidance will become a thing because everyone wants to live the the most away from worries and burdens as possible there s more to the app like how the homeless person and the life management specialists will have a rating system but i ll leave it at that hopefully you understand the vision idea a i powered factionalizer this idea goes well with the a i music generator in that it filters out opinions and retains only the facts in any given page or post etc but basically that s what it does through machine learning i don t see if anyone s made this or not idea invest in movies online you know how big budget movies cost around million dollars to make sometimes you know how you can invest in companies worth more than that on the stock market why not give people the option to invest in big budget movies online it would make things easier for the producers and social media users can profit off movie ticket sales an example would be about how it d typically work a movie under preproduction would be posted online and it would be exhibited and social media users would be able to invest in up to half the movies budget and the other half would come from hollywood executives social media should have the option to make money like that plus everyone wins i was thinking of having little easter eggs in there such as how people could get free movie tickets after investing overall more film would be created this way in that it acts as a throttle for the film industry much lower budget films can also be involved people want to make money idea genetic testing community this one i m super excited about celebrities all have similar brains in that their scope and visions are grand i was thinking of gathering the dna of multiple celebrities and using machine learning algorithms to find similarities between how their minds work and applying those algorithms to the general public i feel that anyone with a social media account should be given a free genetic test i ll explain how this is to be funded later and algorithms from the above method should be used to find people who they really may know not a stab at facebook but i feel that s what the future is going to be about people similar to one another will want to hang out with one another and this would spawn new things like new baseball teams for example and new workspace environments you might be wondering how i m going to get the genetic data of multiple celebrities i was thinking that this could happen through the investment phase of whenever google or facebook or even apple decides to make the idea in celebratory fashion conclusion i wanted to put all ideas in one app idea and allow it to make the world a better place

0,should the law allow others to control your bionic implants against our will edit i meant against your will in the title sorry i feel that neural interfaces for bionic implants are no longer a thing reserved for the far far future every few months i hear about progress with limb or eye implants that have some basic neural interface with their wearer in addition technology miniaturization has long reached a level where the computing power of a phone can fit inside the body and it will soon be able to power itself from the energy produced by the body something researched for heart pacemakers one of the fundamental powers governments have over their people is that of controlling information you can t record everything everywhere e g no recording of us supreme court sessions no recording the movie you re seeing in a cinema no recording inside retail stores etc all these entities have the arbitrary power to limit what an individual can share with others or tell with any credibility since there s no proof to back up sensitive claims furthermore the education system is largely based on the ability to mechanically repeat some study material refined testing of actual in depth understanding occurs only in very high profile expensive learning institutions if students can have a neurally implanted bionic eye then they can also interface with a computer that allows browsing and searching through locally stored learning material without the human showing any signs of it from the outside the education system will be shaken from the roots as it will be trivially easy for anyone to get a college degree without actually understanding the curriculum so the question arises if anyone will have the ability to control these implants against their wearer s will or discriminate against those having the implants examples should a human having x stronger than normal bionic arms and legs be stripped of them because he might use them to harm overpower others when walking in a court room or in a hospital or in a prison or in a rented building or on anyone else s private property should a human having a bionic eye be stripped of it when taking an exam because he might hide a computer that allows him to easily browse through the curriculum and how to you ensure nobody hides this kind of computer within their bodies you scan them what about those with legitimate implants any such implant can hide a neurally linked computer do you humiliate them by in depth scanning their bodies for implants do you use an external kill switch for all their implants and cripple them while they take the exam i feel the bionic implants have the potential to dramatically change our society as soon as they are available in even basic form recording everything you see and being able to access it and share it with others will become a basic human right or else we ll step into an unimaginable dystopia what do you think
0,what will happen when automation really kicks in some thoughts on overpopulation unemployment and civil unrest as i mentioned in my previous thread automation will replace most jobs yes but will we even need significant income i think that ultimately automation will be a good thing and most people will be able to live a better life but my theory depends heavily on the assumption that people would have the necessary equipment in the first place i was looking at the national occupational employment and wage estimates for the united states and i realized we re going to face a very turbulent future indeed the consesus in this sub seems to be that production occupations will be the first sector to become automated jobs there alone then i guess it s transportation jobs food preparation and serving employs people with related to fast food alone sales and related occupations with working on grocery stores general merchandise stores clothing stores department stores and gasoline stations that s jobs with plenty of other industries i haven t mentioned if we assume a automation rate for the next years which is reasonably low imo that s people becoming unemployed in the sectors i mentioned above i said in my previous thread about automation that people won t even need significant income but my theory s weakness is that it relies on the assumption that people would be able to afford d printers computers and materials in the first place this made me very concerned of americans have under in savings survey finds this means it s very likely that whenever the next industrial revolution really kicks in the vast majority of the american population won t be able to afford what they need to subsist without a job what does that mean in practical terms the first thing that comes to mind are politicians this will look very bad on them and they ll try to do whatever they can so that they re able to say they ve created jobs we re already seeing strikes and even vandalism because of uber and that s not even automation related what happens when cabs don t even have drivers anymore some countries like japan are already embracing them but i d bet many taxi drivers in other countries will vandalize driverless cars i think corporations will be vilified for replacing human workers even though it ll make things cheaper faster and more efficient for everyone involved people constantly mention basic income as a solution but i don t think that would work governments would have to increase the corporate tax burden because the average worker wouldn t have that high an income to be taxed and jobs would be dropping like flies already what happens when they try to tax companies and distribute basic income what already happens really companies will just move elsewhere and even more people will lose their jobs smaller countries with small populations will make themselves tax havens so that their own politicians can get some of that money even if it s a very low percentage because in the end some income for them is better than none at all with companies moving away and people losing jobs the federal government s revenue will decrease rapidly but at the same time government spending on welfare will be higher than ever before and this is when i see major civil unrest taking place d printed guns and perhaps even explosives will be widespread and things could get ugly really fast what do you think i really don t see how this could be prevented

0,what is crypto cloud mining crypto cloud mining is somewhat similar to that of crypto mining with one basic difference it is a relatively easier ask considering the example of bitcoin s mining process it uses a data center in a remote location and pooling in the electricity consumed by the processors at associated peripherals in other words instead of mining by a particular individual the process is outsourced or contracted to a third party typically an organization who can bear the burden of the cost of electricity and central processing units cpu that does all the mining of bitcoin on behalf of the users without using their own computers however if one really wants to protect his savings and investment in fiat currency the person can opt for bitcoin mining instead of being bogged into the cumbersome management of the equipment and associated paraphernalia and in this regard crypto cloud mining is the next best substitute as this concept provides earning and owning the coins or token you can use the cloud to earn your coins in essence the purpose of mining cryptocurrency will be better understood if one quickly breezes through some technological connotations associated with bitcoin and another cryptocurrency in an oversimplified way such as hash the blockchain proof of work pow and proof of stake pos importance of hash function primarily hash is a mathematical functional tool that assists the miners to translate alphanumeric codes into a heavily encoded random fixed length number for security reasons usually in hexadecimal for bitcoin s blockchain management creating a hash with the help of an algorithm is vital whether it be a single word or a sentence by using hash the output is in hexadecimal or fixed length making it very difficult to decipher designing a hash algorithmic function is much need of the day as it empowers the miners to provide secured encryption in crafting a new block subsequently hashing demands exponential cpu output on a mass scale thus leading to an increase in expenses therefore to lure and encourage both individual miners and mining companies to incur a substantial amount of capital expenditure with state of the art technology the organization behind the development of crypto incentivize them it is done by providing them with the option of in the shape of coins a transaction fee denominated in fiat currency it is vital to mention here that miners are awarded only if the created hash is in congruence with the requirements and criteria specified in terms and conditions cryptocurrency is expected to take over future modes of payments more specifically because of the blockchain technology if you are a miner or a buyer who seeks to own any cryptocurrency for the purpose of doing transactions you need a wallet to use them bytus wallet allows you to do your transactions by converting your crypto into fiat currency without having to incur any type of transactional costs having a bytus wallet is preparing for the future that is dominated by these cryptocurrencies

0,the job eating damage of automation may have been hidden by changing demographics we re all used to seeing the roller coaster chart of labor force participation since the s and the argument goes if technology and automation has truly been hurting employment numbers since the information age began then we wouldn t have seen that labor force participation number rise between the s and the s because it means more people have been finding employment rather than fewer but the chart below is broken out by gender on that chart the labor force participation rate for men whose workforce involvement hadn t been changed by social or political movements has seen a steady decline while the same number for women has grown to approximate the participation of men and then begun to mirror the decline in labor force participation of men that suggests that the bump on the first chart may have had more to do with the civil rights revolution and with women entering the work force from the s onward than with any broad long term trend in other words these charts are actually perfectly consistent with an overall employment trend over the last years that follows the curve of the male only line a gradual but inexorable decline in human involvement in the labor force certainly not conclusive but interesting very interesting cross posted to r technology and originating from this thread

0,is it sure that pseudo messianism is a mistake in  i think that the first futurologists were messianists solution ists since hawking and others predict a feasible mind saving nano computer on another planet it is evident that most of us here will live on the mind plane or as a soul forever and there will be someone responsible for symbolically presiding that cyber future and he will be looked at as a massiah and probably there will be movements which will demand that this person should be somehow connected to traditional messiah fantaises like havinga davidic ancestry like most kingly and aristocratic and some jewish rabbinic families in england germany poland russia hungary etc it is irrealistic to imagine that the many psychological mechanism present now among us will simpy disappear just because there will be not totally unforeseeable technical advances we are humans with ups and downs to discredit messianism as our grandparents discredited the oppressive collctive hypnotic trance religions is a non reflexive clich we should welcome messianistic dreamers and thinkers because as immortal minds we will have enough time to research the topic and it will be evident that the conflicting claims about this saviour will continue to cause conflicts and we have to deal with that in a less barbarous way

0,nationalization instead of ubi as a solution to automation universal basic income ubi is increasingly becoming the prime solution to the problem of joblessness due to ai and automation oddly enough many unlikely supporters are rising up throwing in their vote these supporters include bill gross and elon musk why are the rich and powerful in support of ubi the reason behind the wealthy supporting ubi is because they fundamentally don t have to change they still have the power and the wealth markets will still exist classes will still exist with the rulers bourgeois reigning at the top ubi fits nicely into the capitalist modes of production and in fact ubi is a capitalist solution to automation ubi is not socialism or communism in any sense of those two words that said ubi will no doubt lift many people out of poverty and deny some folks from entering that world of desperation ubi is much better than what we have now but we nonetheless can do more instead of allowing profits to continue being raked in for basic human needs nationalize these products let simple but adequate housing be free let rice beans healthy vegetables and fruits be free let health care and clothing be free people will be granted access to basic requirements as opposed to free money to be spent into competing markets nationalization solves the problems of automation just like ubi except we move forward shifting power from the top to the displaced workers ubi has its own set of problems that nationalization will avoid entirely for example what about the long term effects of ubi suppose of people get per month while the continue owning the means of production that is the wealthy leaders of society own the machines materials and decision making around products the will be handed over to the every month by the entire the wealth of the ruling class will continue to grow while the remain owner less and dependent on that monthy allowance at what point can we even say money has value if the wealthy own all of it since ubi allows markets to exist then we know these markets need consumers and to maximize profits owners must make certain their products are consumed as often as possible therefore ubi does not aid in any environmental solutions ubi like markets give no incentive for manufactures to stop creating shitty products so that customers will continuing buying new models under nationalization without markets there is no need to be so inefficient and wasteful some might claim nationalization has a history of failures since industries are controlled by governments would not ubi be regulated by the government what if politicians are pressured to keep the monthly handouts low with nationalization all that matters is enough production is met to meet the needs of society and much of that work is delegated to automation

0,vr g ai inevitable negative effects on children i ve been working to improve the safe healthy and productive use of mobile screen for young children these last two years but i ve recently recognized that even though the research on the negative effects of children s screen time is still being debated we are moving full speed ahead with technologies like vr g and ai powered applications here is what gravely concerns me about these and why i think it s essential that national governments globally led by the eu or the us assign a expert led task forces to pressure relevant law making bodies while engaging with a mobile app ai infers a child s interests and demographics by analyzing the child s actions and choices and then it presents the child with highly personalized content and targeted advertising this ai activity is dangerous for a child because a child does not understand that their experiences are not purely coincidental therefore there is a strong possibility that a child will come to prefer to live in this personalized digital world rather than in the actual world vr headsets are going to amplify the negative effects of this ai powered personalized world if mobile screen time is considered dangerous partly because a parent cannot co view content as easily as they can on a tv what about vr headsets where the viewing is limited to the user what is more worrisome is that over time the child may not be able to easily distinguish the content experienced in vr recorded and streaming video video games and video chat from real life therefore a virtual realistic life that is also personalized will surely be a life that is preferred to real life to boot with this technology developers and content creators will possibly influence a child s thinking in scary ways directing not only the child s future consumer behaviors but even shaping the child s philosophical political and religious thought then there is what some call the electricity of the new era g which ties all of the other technologies together g will enable any internet connected device blazing fast speeds with low latency verizon claims that g will deliver speeds roughly times faster than what is possible with g latency could drop into the single milliseconds making lag times nearly impossible to detect so that means that ai processed data can travel from device to device or device to server and back with nearly zero latency and images streaming from the other side of the world even from the outdoors can appear through vr headsets as if the child is actually present have you thought much about this how to start a conversation on these new technologies as parents already feel overburdened today with managing screen time i share more details on this whole idea my op ed published by venturebeat u s needs a task force to examine risks ar vr and g pose to kids

0,a great community some good things for the future and plans i can make i am so glad to have discovered this community on reddit i am so excited in what the future holds for us i am an optimist i am more excited than i am afraid i am glad it s medicine continues to advance i look forward to more covid vaccinations to start being widely distributed hopefully pretty soon this pandemic ends i am also looking forward to many more medical advances i am glad to be in the st century i want to live it all i want to get to live to see the nd century begin i find it so possible with the way things are going and are soon to be here i am currently years old i am turning later this year in august i look forward to turning many more years i am lucky that all four of my grandparents are still living my parents didn t get to know their four grandparents for now i am getting a girlfriend i hope to already fall in l love with her i want to get married in the near future i want to live to celebrate many wedding anniversaries with my wife too i was diagnosed with asperger s syndrome as a young child i first got diagnosed with kidney problems in i got another condition called valley fever in but i look forward to the future with these and other chronic conditions to be reversed that way it means being very healthy again i have seen that pretty soon we ll have nanobots to strengthen the immune system which would be capable of reversing chronic diseases in anyone having them i have seen online that is the year to begin to look forward to these nanobots becoming common i am already looking forward to besides time flies and will get here pretty quickly i am excited for longevity and long lives to come there is nothing more wonderful than life i find living to be the best thing ever to do i want to live old enough to see my great grandchildren in person i have seen online more recently that the time for us humans to normally live to turn years old is already here i think that one reason why we re so tied to life is because of us humans designed to live longer and we can even conquer death sometime in the future we can end aging in the near future too with this we can live longer than ever i want to get to live for a long time i have seen more recently that we humans are made to last for years as in the human lifespan limit though life extension technologies could enable us to live even longer than that aging is a major cause of degenerative diseases like alzheimer s diabetes and heart disease so with ending aging we can prevent these diseases and live for a long time i look forward to artificial intelligence ai robots to be common let s make them common in the whole world let s just have them be controlled or something to make sure that they don t take everything away from humans these ai robots can work in hospitals to save more lives than ever i ve seen on a tv channel about history that technologies to make us smarter are coming in the future i am so excited about it that way we can do things like learn a language faster see things we currently cannot see end many diseases and think even more i look forward to virtual and augmented realities to have only a screen but not a device like a smartphone in that case we can use the technologies anywhere at any time we should just get used to a post privacy world as a result i would be interested in self driving vehicles since we humans can make mistakes while driving once in a while depending on how we drive such a vehicle would be suitable for anyone then we have no car accidents i hope to see many flying cars around i want to be able to go around the world fast with fast airplanes with flying cars however they can compete with airplanes the same goes for fast trains to compete with airplanes i want to see space travel being popular and affordable for the general population i would be interested in going to space to travel we can get to know other worlds i do wish to live to be years old and in that case it s my turn to turn that old in but if i make it to age i don t mind either even with today s medicine we still die young i have seen on a book that dying before age means dying prematurely i m excited for the future in which we get to normally live to age and beyond with a longer life we get to make all our dreams come true and make more dreams i myself want my dreams to all come true i can do so with a longer life to live i have learned languages since i know english and spanish for life i was born in mexico and raised in the united states i have learned french and german since and i have been learning romanian and russian since about november of this past i proposed to continue with romanian and russian in this something i have done so far every day of i want to continue with romanian and russian for and and after that i want to learn languages of armenian turkish portuguese and mandarin chinese i have a goal for fluency in ten languages but living longer means getting to learn even more languages fluently with a year lifetime i may get fluent in languages or so if i do a lot of studying but new technologies to make us smarter are to come too in which case we can learn languages faster than ever yes i also want to make my other dreams come true of finding my ancestors writing in so many diaries being into nudism live to see my children and grandchildren grow up see my great grandchildren in person travel in the world use upcoming technologies go to space like the future holds for us normally and see about continuing to study in higher education i would be happy to live to see myself married for years or more with a wife we should definitely think about what gifts to give for a th wedding anniversary i love a song firework by katy perry which goes if you only knew what the future holds after a hurricane comes a rainbow i look forward to so many good things in the future i love doing things so in the future with us living longer than ever we can do so much this is something i just can t help but feel exhilarated about we then will live to see more of our descendants i m so optimistic about the future and let s make the future so awesome

0,issues with basic income i am all for the concept of a basic income but there s obvious hurdles that come to me for a bi to work it needs to be heavily funded through taxes obviously coming more from the rich people so business owners and such will be looking to automate to save money but they will be paying for people s livelihood anyways through higher taxes to pay for the basic incomes for people who they put out of work like think about the long term loads of jobs go away let s say unemployment happens in a big automation boom even with a basic income of a month these people will be poor because the world isn t going to make a decision to all lower prices on everything so these people can afford to live there s barely any new jobs in this scenario so this unemployment number stays the same for a long period how much of a tax increase do you think it d take to fund even a k monthly income so do the people who can t find work then deserve to be poor even with that income if cost of living doesn t come down how is it going to work what about the people making let s say k a year who end up being put out of work they can t find jobs even if they went to college to get a degree who is paying for that only a super small portion of grads would be finding work anyway so these people now are forced to live on a basic income of let s say a generous k yearly half of what they were making now what how much taxes would it take to give a unemployed nation k a month if let s say in a far future scenario of the workforce is unemployed what then where does the money come from you cant tax incomes that aren t there do businesses get taxed harder and how hard how much more money will a business owner need to make than someone on a basic income at that point for the owner to see the business as being worthwhile enough to not say screw it close up and move to a bi themselves probably double if so then would there be enough money to go around to tax businesses only so much that the owners won t make less than double bi and also be able to support the bi from the taxes that are collected well i will stop there with questions

0,the truth about tesla s autopilot and its ai i keep seeing articles as well as posts about ai and this idea that it is a blackbox as if developers don t know how it works i d like to debunk this idea and give everyone a crash course in ai the technology that drives tesla first off it s a neural network there s a fundamental difference between the two ai is a general form of machine learning teaching the computer to do something that is task oriented such as a bot in a game in other words the bot finds a path avoids objects and attempts to attack a player conversely a neural network adjusts it s behavior based on a set of information known as the training model how is a training model built though it s actually pretty simple okay that s a lie a very high level explanation is that a developer provides a series of fields that the neural network using these fields and setting various options about how the neural network interprets data a prediction is made based on given values as for this blackbox concept it is ridiculous i ll break this down into explanations it s just math and probabilities seriously that s it it s linear algebra differential equations and complex statistical models it is gradient descent so by the logic of these articles saying neural networks are a black box i guess a ti calculator operates like one as well once you have this not only can you view how it responds to test data but graph it s response over time to view its accuracy so this idea that it changes its response every time and that it could make erratic predictions is nonsense so long as the trained model remains the same the prediction will as well assuming as data is identical i hope this demystifies some of the claims about how a tesla operates autonomously if you re interested in knowing more about this stuff just look for classes in python and tensorflow or for a mathematical explanation there are some great articles like but this is a very technical paper for those already familiar with these concepts i was discussing primarily unsupervised learning as that is what tesla likely uses thanks for reading

0,predictions medium term  ideas hello i decided to dedicate another post to some predictions i will try to propose several possibilities of how our society could look like in and after some recearch i hope i can offer some good predictions i prevented to predict about politics or economics i just feel a bit scared about predicting about matters like capitalism and ubi because i feel like i will get attacked if my logic does not make sense to you i am sorry i am not an adult and my reasoning might not make alot of sense i used some of my predictions but mostly if they will still be sicnificant probability extremly likely electric cars and semi trucks will have a majority or sicnificant minority share in many developed nations car fleet because of the plummeting drop of battery prices and sicnificant increases in battery density and charging time infrastructure electric cars will become practical and cheap renewable energy solutions whit the help of storage methods becomes the method of choise to extract energy many developed and possibly developing countries will have a sicnificant share of green energy in their energy mixes autonomous cars will reshape the way we travel and in developed countries that are able to afford digital infrastructure to support this type of transport we will start seeing major reforms in how we see car based travel level autonomy might even be a lawfull requirement in some countries effectivly banning human based driving this might steer controversy and debates likely very likely automation will start reshaping and taking over more and more jobs around of jobs and tasks might be automatef by this point this will become a problem because many poeple will be left without a job and create an incomless underclass of poeple there is also the fact that for many poeple work is a reason to live this might stir up debates about what it means to be human and a need for economic reforms to redistribute the work that remains available iot technologies might be widespread and make our lives easier things like robotic kitchens in combination whit self driving delivery robots and or drones garden services might be done by community owned landmower robots and a road may be able to be repaired by a robot human workforce once a camera notifies someone likely will probably happen vr will become a normal part of life i am not saying we will see emmersive vr systems but maybe something like compact vr glasses in combination whit something that solves movements will probably already be good enough however this will come to be poeple will starts spending sums of their time in these worlds where they can meet up from the comforts of their homes ar will be mainstream and responsive entire cities and towns will be ar mapped and it could be usefull for showing you the way customising your visual enviroment like making it seem sunny durring a cloudy day and helping you remember names ar could be implemented into contact lenses or lenses that replace your natural eye lenses via implants by now and powered by wireless power transmission entire fake personalities could be created by ai they will probably not be able to reason and or think like a human but imitate them very well via ar technologies they could be projected into the real world and some poeple might only have ai friends in an effort to solve traffic we might start seeing more solutions for travel like flying electric cars and an ultra fast way of travel like supersonic planes or maglev trains a moon base has been estabelished probability will maybe happen there might be a few fusion plants that deliver a net positive of electricity to the grid huge survealliance systems will start giving poeple a social credit score to judge poeple wich rights they deserve or do not deserve this does not have to be per se as infriltive as the chinese version huge sums of the world are now part of a cashless society poeple will use bci s frequently communications via telephatic messages and solving spinal issues might become an option tho it will probably wait for itself untill the latter half of the s i do see this happening in some form probability unlikely to happen agi is achieved

0,i designed a crewed interstellar spacecraft hi everybody i would like to share with you a crewed interstellar spacecraft which i have designed and called solar one it employs a combination of propulsion methods nuclear fusion beam powered propulsion and photon propulsion basically several compact fusion reactors power a laser system that propels a huge light sail physicist robert forward already proposed in to use a tw laser system to propel a km light sail a fresnel lens to focus the beam of the laser and decelerate the spacecraft with a secondary light sail i propose something a bit different which is to use to use for example a tw laser to propel a km light sail that would deploy from the spacecraft after the acceleration stage use parabolic mirrors that gradually change their orientation in order to focus the laser beam and finally use a photon rocket to decelerate the spacecraft in theory it could be possible to achieve the speed of light reaching the closest potentially habitable exoplanet in less than years there are of course many challenges like building high energy continuous wave lasers reducing the weight of the nuclear fusion reactors and of course achieving effective nuclear fusion first and minimizing the effects of zero gravity during such a long trip what do you guys suggest to overcome these challenges this is my paper and a short video that summarizes all
0,singularity anxiety as we approach the singularity some will get more excited some will get more anxious i just realized that the closer we get to the singularity the more we will talk about it more poeple will hear about it more people will think about it and more will either get exited or anxious about it i wonder how many will fear it and what they might fear will happen some now fear it will not only be the end of mankind but the manner in which we will meet our end would not be able to be predicted if many believe that then they will go to great lengths to stop it convincing them otherwise would likely be difficult at best it will be interesting to see how that unfolds

0,reviewing r  s predictions personally i got all my predictions wrong the thing i m most surprised about is i predicted that go would be beaten by computers by now based on the progress in when deep learning algorithms being able to predict the moves an expert would make of the time some of my other predictions weren t entirely serious or were unlikely like predicting specific events which are of course unpredictable and random that thread was encouraging silly predictions so don t judge it too harshly i m also surprised at my other prediction that qa systems like watson would become common i really thought that was just around the corner it may still be last thing that i predicted seriously was big improvements in facial recognition and license plate readers this has happened a bit but i don t actually recall hearing that much news about it in all of my predictions revolved around ai because that s the thing i was really interested in in and saw huge announcements every single week about i had been keeping up with many of the notable papers and read lots about it now i just feel burned out i stopped following it so closely and lost a lot of my interest in it somewhat i haven t been checking r  very frequently and post here a lot less hopefully brings my interest back anyway here are some other some other prediction threads i think it s safe to say we suck at predicting the future but to be fair a year is not a very long time for interesting things to happen and no upvotes or posts uninteresting predictions

0,odes describing exponential technological growth so for instance kurzweil loves to put data on a log lin plot and show that various indicators of technology grow exponentially let s pick cost per computation a skeptic would question if he s cherry picking data or point out that other growth models can look roughly linear on a log lin plot at least locally it would be much more convincing if we can make some simple but solid arguments for why you would expect exponential growth instead of just observing it from historical records exponential growth comes from simple odes for instance dp dt r p t p t where p dollars gflop or whatever if the rate r p is fairly constant in p then you can expect exponential growth it would be even better if r p increases when p does but why is this kind of model valid and why will r p remain roughly constant indefinitely one obvious answer is that it takes computational power to design the next generation of computers obviously it does but does it do so linearly is this too simplistic
0,in the future passengers can sit in this unique v shaped planes looks a bit strange but flying v this v shaped aircraft has an impressive fuel economy and possesses ergonomics and passenger carrying design not inferior to current long body civil aircraft emissions from aircraft are an issue that is of interest to the whole world but until we find a good fuel source to replace gasoline and oil it will be difficult to reduce the emissions generated from air transport however the flying v aircraft research project promises to help solve this problem in the near future flying v aircraft research project is the investment result of dutch national airline klm royal dutch airlines the flying v project is the work of justus benad who was an engineering student at berlin university and developed by researchers at the delft university of technology in the netherlands tu delft unlike most traditional aircraft designs flying v combines passenger cabin fuel tank and cargo on both sides of the wings according to the disclosure flying v uses less fuel than the a while it can carry around people which is roughly the same as the passengers of airbus a with a meter wingspan design the aircraft is suitable for all existing airport and cargo infrastructure around the world amp xb mr pieter elbers ceo and chairman of klm believes that the partnership with tu delft will help increase the sustainability of the airline industry however a problem with this plane is the ability to spin and move in the sky with conventional planes one side of it will flip up and the other will descend to redirect the aircraft not to mention previously the passengers still sat along the fuselage and thus created balance and a sense of stability but with the seat design on both sides of the airplane wing the feeling of traveling may be more like a roller coaster than an airplane roelof vos head of the flying v research project at tu delft said the innovation in aircraft design is necessary to bring high efficiency in transport operations and beyond that can serve delivery develop electric powered aircraft amp xb vos shared we cannot electrify the entire fleet because the aircraft gets electrified when it becomes too heavy and it is difficult to fly across the atlantic using electricity alone that technology cannot be implemented even in the next years so we have to come up with new technologies to reduce fuel consumption in different ways currently the aviation industry is contributing about of global co emissions and the number will continue to increase if people do not do something more sustainable it is estimated that by this number may reach whether the aircraft s fuel efficiency may increase depends largely on its aerodynamic design especially the weight of the aircraft the team expects to continue to change the aircraft model in september the simulation of the new cabin design will open to the public at the schiphol airport in amsterdam netherlands in october it is expected that if the research is completed the aircraft will be in commercial operation from to therefore from now until then the design and features of this aircraft project will change pretty much refer to cnn

0,given the way things are going i am afraid china could get to singularity faster than the west once singularity is reached the game is set the group which reaches it first will rule over those who did not for ever one very little known fact is that russia out of all countries was a major destination for scientists and technicians during the th century russia was not exactly considered as part of western civ until peter the great opened that country to the west and invited as many westerners as possible although there were setbacks russian reactionaries tried to turn back the clock by moving the capital back to moscow and putting a grandson of peter i to the throne to reverse all of the reforms thankfully that boy czar was poisoned before he did any real damages petersburg became a hotbed of science and tech which also housed out of all people bernhard euler unfortunately he left there during the time the above incident took place the romanov dynasty ended on although the name was kept till all czars after catharine ii were germans but still petersburg was a good place to get away from the turmoils of europe with strong protection from the czar they did not mingle with the local population and czar s guards made sure nobody messed with these more advanced people eventually their descendants became quite dominant in russian politics science and tech until the russian revolution killed or drove almost all of them out as europe gets hotter with turmoils it is likely that ambitious and smart europeans will find themselves in china hong kong or singapore where they can walk at night hk and singapore always had a sizable western enclave the people living there keep separate from the locals and the police take a good care of the locals who try to mess with them same for the richer chinese cities like shanghai or canton with the arrival of smarter europeans who long to be safe combined with local talents it is possible that china the other two locals are under chinese influence could get to the singularity faster than any westerner could imagine china has no concern over human rights and other bullshit and could do a manhattan project without answering to its people and with the addition of the europeans fleeing the refugees for a safer location it is likely that parts of the major chinese cities will be reserved for these new arrivals with existing inhabitants forcibly removed something unthinkable in the west but very common in asia xi jinping of china will get a reputation of catharine ii of russia an enlightened despot that s why the west has to speed up on singularity if the west won t china will

0,musk war could end tech growth solution idea in a recent article in cnet elon musk said most of us instinctively assume that technology relentlessly marches forward but there have been times before now in human history after the egyptians built the pyramids for instance or after the multiple advances of the roman empire when the civilizations that followed could no longer do what had been done before and perhaps there s a complacency and arrogance in assuming that this won t happen again in this quote musk mentions all technology which includes his mission to mars as well as the subject matter of most posts in r  some background on war as we recognize this holiday season most americans are having a hard time dealing with money already in order to fix this i strongly think we would need to reenact executive order which president kennedy signed into law on june this law created an american currency rather than one from a for profit private bank otherwise the near future of the u s looks bleak for our children
0,evolution of humans on terraformed mars and other planets with the likelihood of human colonisation of mars becoming increasingly likely and the eventual colonisation of the rest of the solar system along with it it s interesting to think how in many thousands of years after terraforming has occurred the descendants of the colonists may have evolved and branched off of homo sapiens for mars i can think of a few possibilities such as the lower levels of natural sunlight may lead to humanoids shedding all hair on their bodies including head hair in order to absorb more sunlight i would guess eyebrows at least would remain the lower gravity may lead to them becoming less muscular and having a more slender build especially the males can any of you think of any more examples for mars or any other potentially colonised planet

0,if there is a world solution but requires a lot of work would you help hello redditer friends for the last years i ve been working on a project to truly change our world for good and improve the way we live our life and interact with our environment after a lot of crazy ideas and perspectives i found the one and only way to do so first of all i am totally certain that i have the better way to improve our world to a better place without chaos and violence and i thought i could do it myself but after all this time and thousands of papers and graphics i understand that i can t make this huge task alone so i need your help i have the project done but i need help to arrange it in a good presentation if you want to help me save our world please let s make it together i know there s no way to change our system from night to day but this project is a perfect transition path to make the current system outdated in order to make it happen there s a lot of complex issues that some beliefs or thougs may interfere and i want to make clear that we do not want to defend or attack any belief or creed but if we are committed to save the world from ourselves we need to be factual and hold on to the scientific method which is and always was our truly guide to improve our lives we have a outdated system that fail to effectively manage our resources and life quality and cause too much bad symptoms in our society and we need to update it eventually i have the peaceful solution i know that is a hell of a heavy thing to say but i really know that it will work i can explain every detail of the project although i know that there s a lot of issues and variables that make it be enormous i will try to solve every doubt you may have after i tell you the draft of the project and you can help me make it better we humans are always better together and together with earth will can be even greater i know that i have no right answer for every question and problem we may encounter but i know one answer that fits them all we can figure it out together we first need to understand what s going on and where we are in order to be ready to go forward modern society has been very productive and we kind of dominated the outside world and yet fail to understand the inside and still a group of bearly evoluted species of apes which is dramatically changing it s own environment we have to stop it and we can now no wars no fight no violence if we use the actual system to make a better one and left this one outdated we will succeed in changing society for good i m going to create a business company that it s fully compromised in being sustainable and produce what we need to maintain the company in all documented history of mankind we never have lived in peace even if we always had abundance which in part led to conflicts and segregation to another race or species in order to create a world of peace and abundance we can not use the same ways that were tried and failed in past ages we must focus on the real problems and work on it so what are we trying to accomplish here have nothing to do with capitalism socialism communism or whatever is a effective company similar management system focus on improving updating and renewing itself to adapt the variabilities that may come the very real owner of everything we use it s the earth our planet and in case the owner does not goes well we all gonna sink together and if we don t act right now while we can we definitely will sink it s time for us to forget about the little issues that makes us different and celebrate the diversity of our especies here and now in our lives which is just a brief travel in this one little rock floating few dozens laps around a star somewhere far away in the galaxy if there s intelligent life out there in our universe living their lives in a context we can barely understand than together we re all marginals to that society if we look closely the earth has no boundaries the only one we can see for sure it s the ozone layer separating us from the dark cold vacuum of space at this time nowadays we can easily afford to ensure that war poverty and economic submission never happen again in the future we live in capitalism there s no way we can avoid this issues now it is part of the system so we got to dance like the song and create a profitable business with compromise with the acquisition like a company that wants to get bigger does so again there s no way to avoid it we create a corporation that at first will change the way we see the employer employees relationship this ownership of the employee by the employer is not necessary we think it is a remanescent of the past ages of slavery and submission of the poor that society has come we truly believe that there s no need to such a thing to happen again and that there is a way of making it the relationship between employees and employers much more positive and effective in all aspects of life than changing the enviroment that people live we change the way they behave it is widely known that the human being is a highly manipulable creature we all are being manipulated right now through the midia the institutions the internet the groups that we divide ourselves everything affect the human behavior some things inside others outside improving the quality of the human environment we open space to some others aspects of life to be fullfilled and there begins the real transformation of the human journey through the cosmos i think i already talked too much let s do it people we can do it i just need to settle the presentation and finish the project and then we are ready to execute i will need your help and if you can and want to let me know i still have not a page or a channel to subscribe etc but we can make some chat group or whatever so we can get in touch to make it happen thank you all for the reading and i hope you have a great day it had to start somewhere it had to start sometime no better place than here no better time than now

0,big picture  what if the universe is infinite and always increasing in complexity entropy what if instead of heat death reality just keeps zooming in like a fractal with ever smaller and mostly unpredictable stuff entropy is the only thing we are pretty sure directs our time lines entropy means that reality constantly adds complexity detail taking larger simpler things apart and making more complex stuff with the different pieces which means that there are always more things just that those things are smaller and more detailed this is also evolution so reality is like zooming in on a fractal like the mandelbrot set we may never see large simple suns again but we will continue to see new tinier more weird forms of concentrated energy like batteries and mitochondria as well as forms of life that are microscopic and more complex than even humans eventually whole planets could be the size of an atom at some point essentially this meets the laws of conservation of matter energy while also meeting the laws of entropy more stuff and seemingly more space between the stuff but it s really just adding smaller basic building blocks of matter and energy which seems insane if you think that atoms are literally indivisible as the word originally meant but we know now that they are not we know that now atoms have smaller building blocks and those building blocks have even smaller building blocks so the universe can just keep breaking apart those seemingly unbreakable things to add complexity infinitely no heat death no end to life just ever smaller and more complex life infinitely just like we can calculate pi forever in ever increasing detail perhaps reality is nothing more and nothing less than some grand function generating new fractal patterns and our collective consciousness is simply the function being generated at that point in time maybe this isn t how it actually works but it s interesting to consider and would explain a lot

0,can someone please explain to me how the maturing field of automation can do anything other than destroy net jobs i know there s a lot of people who agree with me on this subject so for that reason i d like to restrict top comments to people who believe that automation will result in job creation for those of you that will be replying directly to this post i want you to respond to the question argument i will post in this thread not arguments you ve seen posted elsewhere i am requesting this because i have never seen my particular question addressed even tangentially my question is this the demand for automation is growing as it grows it is met with an increasingly mature supply side the natural and historical response to increasing demand is not simply adding more labor to the pool but increased innovation this means that the process of automation itself will get easier and easier so at some point it will be cheaper and easier to automate a new job than to train someone to do it this does not require general artificial intelligence of the kind that people like elon musk are worried about it only requires that a single purpose ai robot combo be easier to design and implement for a given task than training a human let s be clear about another thing i am not talking about only existing jobs let s say we live in a future where this tipping point has been achieved and now you great innovator that you are have created a business this business will require labor do you a higher a bunch of humans and spend x dollars and y hours training them or b hire an freelance automation engineer to do it for of the cost and in half the time keep in mind that if you hire humans at some point you will either have to fire some or they will quit meaning that you will have to train more at further cost other arguments have been well when automation get s so good that humans can t compete it ll automatically be a utopia which gets said without any justification and i assume any thought so if this is your position please constrain yourself to the version of events presented in this post and explain why this will be a utopian state of affairs if you think it will never be easier and cheaper to create a software hardware bot than to train a human then explain your reasoning on that too please do not make reference to any past developments in technology without fully explaining why they are relevant now thanks also due to my time zone work schedule i am going to bed now i ll be curious to see what people say when i get the chance to look at this tomorrow

0,my predictions for the world in will probably be nothing all to crazy if i am honest i asked poeple for their opinion here are some of mine predictions sorted by category transportation i expect by that in most western and some eastern countries electric car sales will have surpassed that of ice cars ranges will probably have doubled by then and charging times are under minutes wich make them more attractive some countries may even ban the sale of ice cars hydrogen cars will be kind of like the diesel of today except they will have less market share whit virtually no market share for small cars a very small share for bigger family cars suv and a sicnificant yet not majority market share for trucks i argue that some fundemental problems of hydrogen storage feull cells etc make them impractical for normal cars self driving cars taxis and semjs could potentially be on the road and i expect if they do they would become mainstream in an eyeblink because its so practical hydrogen will probably find a spot in the semi truck market beginning to emerge in planes airbus zero e tho fossil feull planes and semis will remain a majority theg will get disrupted fastly causing medium huall and all semis to get emisionless we may have flying passenger electric drones called urban air mobility but battery tech will have to improve by about wich i expect them to do consumer tech i expect ar glasses and or maybe contact lenses being mainstream not replacing phones but being very handy tools for things like navigation name remembering and even playing some games phones will be more a central part of our lives simplistic iot technologies like video doorbells fridges that can order meals for you ovens that automaticly heath and preheat your food washing machines that fold your clothes curtains that automaticly open and stuff like that will make life a little easier monitoring our health and simplifieng our daily routine work school and income i expect work to be a bit different but not per se transformed jobs like cleaning stocking grocery shelves and cooking could very well be automated whit very little human input overall automating these simpler tasks will decrease working hours and stagnate wages while inflation is still there this will decrease poeples overall purchase parity school will maybe change a bit studies have shown that school needs some change to get students to be more proactive many schools notice attention spans getting shorter and blame students however there are some fundemental problems whit the way we organise their education many students just do not see the point in knowing what a particle model is while they dont know how to pay taxes waking up everyday at a very early time also dos not help so structural changes are needed to improve student performance i hope this will happen more poeple will have to go to universities to get a good job random the exponential growth of cpu s will slow down from a year to something like a year candace however this is not a problem since techniques like quantum computing and ai getting more efficient can composate for this and make progress the same china and the us will compete heavily on this front next gen batteries will be about times denser gaining a wh kg performance the tech center of the world may move to china if the usa fails to catch up and cooperate whit other countries china will surpass the usa in terms of gdp however they will end up in a middle income trap and their rushed rise have caused them to experience a massive amount of greying maybe even surpassing the eu in median age these are some predictions feel free to add more or to critisise hope you like them

0,automation might be cool but don t you feel we may eventually fuck it up i get that automation basic income may feel like a good thing but i fear it may eventually turn bad my main concern is that we may end up automating the things that people like doing creative things for example these are things that people enjoy doing what would happen if these were automated i m sure that may would say we could do it anyways but wouldn t we want to share our work with other people let s say newspapers for example it s a fact that we can still do our own newspapers but wouldn t we want people to read them and surely people couldn t care less about men made newspapers and would rather read automated newspapers that can write millions of articles about millions of different topics we can still do it sure but no one will read them and doing it just for doing it is kinda sad i don t mean that fame should be a goal although it s not that bad a goal but we should at least be able to share it with other people i don t mean there ll be a shortage of means but the value of what we do will be very small to be worth the look to me work is also about human interaction which is an aspect that matters even more in what would eventually be an utopia i do recognize i m being excessively pessimistic what do you guys think

0,deep reinforcement learning progressive neural networks i ve been reading about them a bit more recently and i firmly believe that this is where we ll see many interesting developments in the coming months here s an arvix paper on pnns gt learning to solve complex sequences of tasks while both leveraging transfer and avoiding catastrophic forgetting remains a key obstacle to achieving human level intelligence the progressive networks approach represents a step forward in this direction they are immune to forgetting and can leverage prior knowledge via lateral connections to previously learned features we evaluate this architecture extensively on a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks atari and d maze games and show that it outperforms common baselines based on pretraining and finetuning using a novel sensitivity measure we demonstrate that transfer occurs at both low level sensory and high level control layers of the learned policy and here s a blog post on deep rl gt this is a long overdue blog post on reinforcement learning rl rl is hot you may have noticed that computers can now automatically learn to play atari games from raw game pixels they are beating world champions at go simulated quadrupeds are learning to run and leap and robots are learning how to perform complex manipulation tasksthat defy explicit programming it turns out that all of these advances fall under the umbrella of rl research i also became interested in rl myself over the last year i worked through richard sutton s book read through david silver s course watched john schulmann s lectures wrote an rl library in javascript over the summer interned at deepmind working in the deeprl group and most recently pitched in a little with the design development of openai gym a new rl benchmarking toolkit so i ve certainly been on this funwagon for at least a year but until now i haven t gotten around to writing up a short post on why rl is a big deal what it s about how it all developed and where it might be going it seems a bit shocking that we ve had all this progress and yet we still haven t gotten around to crossing these two methods deep reinforcement learning is a very very important step towards the development of artificial general intelligence but none of it matters if the ai can master pong but completely fail at pac man despite both games being on the atari and utilizing some similar skills imagine you learned how to bake a cake after tries you finally bake a perfect cake better than any other person can in fact wonderful right but when you go to bake brownies you have to learn everything from scratch you need more shots just to relearn how to bake these things despite the fact there isn t much difference between a cake and brownies in terms of preparation that s where ai is now we can teach ai how to bake cakes and we can teach ai how to bake brownies but we can t teach ai how to bake cakes and then brownies which is a pretty massive handicap for intelligence to say the least one of the most fundamental aspects of what defines something as being intelligent is the ability to use past experiences to predict the future when i say predict i m not necessarily saying anything ridiculously abstract like going into the stock market or figuring out higher level physics from simple experiments no i mean figure this out based on what you ve learned from something else like my previous analogy said if you can bake a cake you can bake brownies if you can t then there s something fundamentally wrong with your brain you shouldn t have to relearn how to measure ingredients when you re making a new but similar dish so in that sense we ve figured out one aspect of machine learning but it s still useless without the ability to reason or experience memory feedback pnns are a step in that direction
0,implications of elon musk s ideal factory for those who are not familiar tesla is building a battery factory in nevada that upon completion will be the largest building in the world by footprint its appropriately wide eyed name is gigafactory the giga referring to its intended multi gigawatt output and the promising that it is just the first of many as of today said factory is about complete and already in active production but the factory itself is not the most interesting thing about it rather it s the idea behind it that is generating shockwaves among futurists in multiple tweets and guest interviews elon musk has discussed the general concept of a factory not as it has been an expensive sequence of frankenstein contraptions cobbled together impatiently and then ignored once they operate adequately but as a product in itself that can be integrated and honed toward the utmost limits of physics this thought was the origin of gigafactory it is musk s pilot experiment toward an automated general manufacturing facility something so efficient so tightly interwoven and operating at such blinding speed compared to today s factories that in the very long term analogies to a chemical reaction become conceivable such a thing would be so exotic compared to the human centric factory that musk has said its interior would look like an alien dreadnought such a dizzying concept seems like the product of a very active imagination but in fact arises from the simplest of origins musk has a philosophy of starting and ending with the basic laws of physics mass volume speed energy time unit output per unit volume per unit time everything between input and output is just details that can be computed and focused toward the optimum it sounds so simple that it immediately raises the question of why it isn t already a universal standard the answer is equally simple and depressing big business in general does not operate on the principle that it exists to make things but rather to increase the market value of its stock in the quickest and most convenient ways possible even if this sacrifices long term potential that has led to all sorts of short sighted decisions that hamper innovation rather than improving it particularly widely distributed outsourced supply chains where accountability is impractical it takes forever to propagate ideas and any link in the chain can sabotage change for its own interests as a result of such outsourcing excesses the very first principle of musk s ideal factory is not a new concept but rather an old one that had been abandoned in the modern corporate environment vertical integration the more steps in the process you can include inside the black box between input and output the bigger the value that can be added by optimization however privately held big business is aware of and practices vertical integration yet has failed to produce such ideal factories ifs this is because businessmen as a general culture are by and large believers in profit maximization ideology and view production solely as a means to profit rather than profit as a means to production so their innovations are usually aimed to create merely relative advantage over competitors just enough to leverage market share rather than maximum absolute progress that exerts a pressure on civilization overall those are the two epiphanies represented by the if concept vertical integration can maximize the speed and potency of technological advancement and cost reduction that potential only occurs if the optimization principle of the vertically integrated process is technological advancement and cost reduction rather than profit maximization profits will occur as a helpful side effect that accelerates the process but are not the central objective now let s imagine that this ideal factory experiment succeeds knock on wood and the world gradually becomes covered in these alien dreadnought factories churning out pretty much everything we want or can imagine at blinding speed and absurdly low cost let s ignore sidestep the social implications and the measures that will be necessary to ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits and instead just focus on the next technological step from there once you have an optimized black box the natural next step is always expand the box so first you have an ideal factory into which raw materials are fed and out of which an end product is spat like a machine gun musk has stated this rate of production as a literal goal the rate of fire of a machine gun factories that make different things will have a lot of commonalities so then naturally you back branch them together and now you have multi output ideal factories at some point a single if complex turns out such a large spread of what people consume that you begin to approach a new quantum level of manufacturing not just an ideal factory but a general factory gf this is a factory that makes more or less anything as efficiently as physically possible or at least as close as practical reality permits as massive as an if seems today gigafactory will probably seem tiny compared to more evolved iterations we can expect that a general factory would be even more profound in fact we can see the shape of the level after the gf in its own likely immense dimensions since it would occupy such a tremendous volume of resources and employment despite the effects of automation on labor the gf begins to resemble an economy unto itself when the black box expands to include raw material inputs e g mining and agriculture and energy as tesla is already doing you no longer have just general factories you have general economies an economy where production is continually optimized toward the limits imposed by physics and this optimization itself becomes increasingly automated at this point life would look very strange indeed absurdly wealthy and yet terrifyingly ephemeral as the pace of change becomes so explosive that people don t even bother trying to track it they just enjoy the ride and periodically suffer the cataclysms this is not the singularity because the same patterns recur no matter what level you re looking at so events will be comprehensible in isolation just not their exact causal relationship but we re still not done the potency of this idea is such that there is still a ways to go in exploring it what s the next step above an economy that would be an ecosystem or biosphere all the time that this process is unfolding the artificial process is replacing subsuming or forming symbiosis with the natural environment until a functional unity is achieved there is no exact dividing line but at some point a general economy is a general biosphere where the entirety of life on a planet is integrated into a technological process with rational optimization toward let s hope philanthropic objectives and the thing about a general biosphere just like a general economy in earlier eras is that it will be replicable that it will replicate inevitably almost like cell mitosis on an astronomical scale a general factory can seed a city a general economy can seed a nation state and a general biosphere could conceivably seed an entire world all at once we can imagine an era where general factories power colonies on other worlds at a slow pace of growth general economies are established all at once in new places radically expanding the pace of solar system settlement and perhaps more slowly beyond and then general biospheres go on to seed well beyond even that such thoughts induce giddy vertigo so it s understandable why elon musk s companies are such an addictive topic now this all a lot to deduce from someone talking about running a factory more efficiently but it s all there vast implications packed into simple ideas musk has tapped into some mainline insight about what increases the potential of humankind and is pursuing the immediate steps along the only path that doesn t end

0,quantum computing aristotelian logic amp the universe gt it is my general thoughts on the subject you are free to speak your mind in any way possible criticize critic argue whatever goes have a nice read it is clear that the form of computing you have now is not the ultimate stage of the evolution of computer technology quantum computing as it is popularly called is a field that has some potential but it does not have a real potential with the current binary computing system it is necessary to step up to a more advanced form of computing where you do not have just on and off signals but a variety of signals of so to speak gradations in between on and off you may say is not it contradictory that something can be both on and off but the reason why you think so is because scientific inquiry has been based on aristotelian thinking aristotelian logic says that a statement can be true or it can be untrue but it cannot be both true and untrue at the same time the reality is that this is a very limited perspective because you are creating a system where your understanding of reality has to be reduced to statements that can be answered with a yes or a no a true or untrue an on or off what has created the entire universe with all of the multiplicity you see current computing is based on the idea that by combining the two signals on and off in a sequence you can encode all possible information this is a complete fallacy you can only encode the kind of information that can be expressed in an on and off binary mindset nature is not binary human beings do not think naturally in binary system the universe is not either on fully in its present state or off the big bang did not instantly manifest the current physical universe everything has been an evolution what is clear is that this has happened through an infinite variety of the combination of various elements that have even evolved over time so that there are more elements today than there were at the time of what scientists call the big bang event not that i am endorsing that particular philosophy and theory you need to recognize here that for quantum computing to reach its full potential people need to be able to think beyond the binary mindset there will not be a real breakthrough before these other signals could be defined beyond and even with classical computing this mindset is limiting current computer development as an example by now industry are fully capable to develop a ternary based computer that would be much more natural to humans by having a null zero state and on and off states and much more powerful in sense of efficiency and correctness there is a demand for null state in programming world however binary system does not allow naturally it and yet industry insist on continuing to use binary system while no human being programs or solves problems in a binary system nor programming languages designed to be binary in nature and have to find a way to artificially injected the null state this naturally leads to bugs and broken code you cannot fit a square into a circle there is definitely promise in the quantum technology and there will be some breakthroughs in computing even with current chosen mindset computing will not reach its full potential until the current materialistic mindset is transcended by a greater number of scientists technicians inventors economists politicians and people in general so that they can accept that the universe is not materialistic is not mechanical in nature not a closed system its not black and white i m referring to the latest quantum physics discovery that there is a level beyond material realm level that does not behave mechanically and doesn t work like a physical world around us its neither off or on neither energy wave or a particle there is more to it the materialistic worldview actually been outdated since albert einstein discovered that everything is energy why is this matters to computing world scientists in general are trying to use computers to create simulations of all sorts trying to analyze the universe mechanically and on top of it fitting it into using a binary system to give them results that in nature will only be limited and incorrect they are trying to use atom or other as qbit to force it to behave like an ordinary microscopic element however as quantum physics shown those low level elements do not behave normal as a wave particle duality experiment demonstrated if you think about it really the current understanding of quantum physics which is quite frankly incomplete but nevertheless the reason why there is a talk of quantum computing and parallel states and all these things is that quantum physics opened up for the possibility that the universe is not mechanical isaac newton brought forth a philosophy that said that the universe was working according to invariable laws so there were no exceptions in the newtonian worldview in the quantum worldview there is always the possibility that of the time the ball does not pass through the wall but at one point it could happen that the ball passed though the wall this actually demonstrates to you that science is at the point where it needs to recognize that if we want to step up to a higher level we need to recognize that the universe is not mechanical in nature what does it mean that the universe is not mechanical what is it that can create this variableness that makes it possible sometimes to go beyond the laws of nature that function most of the time what is it that could potentially make these laws of nature unnecessary so we transcend them to a higher level well it is precisely consciousness as was again demonstrated by wave particle experiment that consciousness of the scientist does matter and therefore there comes a point where scientists will have to look at the human brain and how the human brain processes information because it is a much more subtle much more multifaceted way this is again the key to understanding the future of computing where you encode information not in a binary way but in a much more multifaceted way there are people who are close to breaking through and understanding this and who are able to tune in to these ideas and not think in an old materialistic mechanical binary way that is when i think true potential of computing will come to shine i think binary computing been dead as idea long time ago and computer industry should have started ternary computer development since at list binary meant to be only a short term solution until technology would catch up and now is a high time to move forward since technology that allows handling it is here i do not see any point turning quantum computing into something lesser if it has much much more potential potential that can only be executed by embracing quantum physics discoveries which as i see it no one truly grasp and there for cannot fathom why on earth qbits can communicate with each other beyond time and space thank you have a good day

0,the double edged sword that s the em drive let me preface this by stating that at this point i am completely on board of the hype train concerning the em drive i am way too excited about the mind boggling implications of this tech to allow my usual scepticism to ruin the party for me now i realise that it is way too premature to assume that this copper contraption will work as advertised but considering the fact that at this point no one has been able to adequately falsify the claims regarding the source of the thrust it seems to be producing and as the days go by the likelihood it can be attributed to experimental errors seem to increasingly diminish i am left wondering what exactly will be our defense against a hypothetical scenario where this device is used as a rod of god on massive steroids by some individual psychopath or group thereof hell bent on destroying our entire planet i am sure most of you realize by now that if this tech pans out it will revolutionize all terrestrial transportation provide limitless energy allow interstellar travel and possibly open the doorway towards effective ftl travel this is too insane to comprehend furthermore it appears to be so incredibly cheap to construct and amazingly easy to build considering all the aforementioned use cases that it in essence will provide a relatively large percentage of the human population to get their hands on one of these potential doomsday devices that will make even the most powerful nuclear bombs look like glorified firecrackers so how do you defend against such a weapon is it at all possible to have an iron dome equivalent for em drive attacks i am envisioning some type of system where you have some x amount of defensive em drives attached to a large body of mass whizzing about in the orbit of earth at relativistic speeds ready to intercept any sign of an incoming hostile em drive attack i am just completely unaware wheter it is possible to detect that a mass is accelerating towards earth with no sign of slowing down at relativistic speeds then transmit that information to a defensive node in time for it to be able hurl itself towards it to prevent it from colliding with earth as much as i love the fact that this tech might actually be the real deal i am worried about the destructive power it will enable the less sane among us to obtain not to mention the implications of the whole warp drive hypotheses that seem to be put forward as possible explanation for the measured thrust is it even physically possible with our current instruments to detect an object that is envelopped in a warp field this is some scary shit

0,this is my theory of the big crunch and the development of memory and recognition systems in atoms so they say that one day the universe will  in on itself the big crunch when that happens a few billion years later the big bang will happen again and eventually the world will come back into existence technically since everything is made of the exact same atoms as before you will come back into existence exactly the same since everything is identical you could have lived this life a million times before currently we have no real way to know here s the big part of my theory it is possible that over time time being millions of trillions of years particles will start recognizing each other the atoms particles that make us can never be destroyed the universe will never  entirely it will all just suck itself into a few little atoms probably the atoms that will collide to make the big bang in the first place so since these atoms are never dying they are always advancing and evolving as they advance they may develope a memory and recognition system in other words eventually the atoms that make you may be able to recognize your entire life exactly as it will happen based on past experiences if this happens that means maybe you yourself could start recognizing the exact same patterns since you re the one whose made of these particles the chances are it would happen slowly over time with tiny little flashbacks here and there kind of like deja vu until at one point everything you did gave you deja vu and then at another point later on you might just be born with the entire knowledge of what your life entails this all would obviously take the joy put of life you would probably enter what s basically a partially vegetable like state doing just enough to stay alive because you know that when you finally do die it ll only be worse next time this will go on theoretically for an incalculable number of years but not eternity you see the particles won t advance in a forward time frame it ll all be backwards look at it this way there s generation and generation is the furthest away so they ll have the most time to evolve they ll be the first ones to go through it until generation goes through that it themselves and never has children because of their depressive state technically you would experience all of this until your parents did and once that happens you re temporarily expunged from existence this could keep on happening until eventually civilization s in on itself generations could continuously disintegrate one by one until eventually only the very first conscious being in all of existence is left again though if this is true then the particles memory may kick in fast enough that they start recognizing their entire life cycle the moment after the big bang so immediately after that happens they all go into place create everything let it live through its timeline quicker than before die and then do it all again even faster this time if this happened the entire universe would eventually just be a huge flash of light the universe being born and darkness it dying light darkness light darkness just getting faster and faster that could always happen after you go through this experience though but if this is true it would all mean that this cosmic flash will eventually happen at some point and if you went through your experience before it did happen this is where you woukd suddenly re enter existence your whole life will flash by in less than one one millionth of a second you ll suddenly snap into existence as will everybody else no one will have enough time to realize what s happening before the particles just rush everything into its final place as the world flashes on and off you may eventually live and die a million times over the course of minutes so does anyone have any thoughts on this theory of mine i call it the cadenic theory

0,why i think solar is unsustainable because it takes land it will last for fewer years as a primary source of energy than fossil fuels open to discussion about this elon musk said that we would need x square miles of solar panels to power the whole us this is only of the land in the contiguous us at first this seems tiny we would never have concerns about not having enough energy until we realize the laws of compound growth if we assumed energy use increased annually then in years we would need to cover all the deserts in the us roughly of all land in years we would have to cover the entire contiguous us but let s assume we get more efficient solar panels panels now are around efficient assuming efficient solar panels we would need the land of the entire us in years let s compare this to fossil fuels fossil fuels became the primary source of energy in the us in about surpassing wood so fossil fuels has been the dominant source of energy for about years then i don t know how much longer they could go before running out but i assume it s more than years fossil fuels will have had a longer tenure than solar could ever have tl dr people say solar is sustainable but solar takes land which is limited in terms of years it will be less sustainable than fossil fuels has been because of compound growth edit its been a good conversation sorry if ive been a prick at points good points were made about being unrealistic i still believe that certain  expectations like the singularity and crazy ai and crazy transportation abilities would rely on pretty high growth rates solar is not a blank check for energy use edit so i guess its square miles to start not one hundred with this staring point we exhaust all deserts in the us at years as others have pointed out anything at a growth rate for a long period of time is totally unsustainable

0,so ive been thinking about bob lazar recently ive been looking alot into anawers of the unknown like most people probably do once in a blue moon and i stumbled across bob lazar now the more i watch on this topic of ufos the more it seems insane so about a week ago the ny times released a article stating that a ex ufo scientist who worked for the government said he can confirm the government have ships not made on earth and that rhe government will address this soon now i think theres two main alien theories going on rightnow that may interlink so ive been watching joe rogan podcasts as you do take what you want from them i think theyre as real as it gets and he spoke to a retired air force maybe navy cant remember commander someone will good credibility and was high in the rankings of his units which obviously shows some sort of credibility he stated that he saw tik tak shaped ships flying in the ocean and that thwse ships would come to earth from space he would be cruising at k feet and you are basically in space at that point and he claims they would come from above k feet and drop down to k then observe and leave in a few hours now this theory is obviously the most proven rightnow with all the tik tak videos becoming declassified and actual pilots explaining the radars and saying it checks out its not even that it could be just this commander thats insane because he had other people with him and saw the same thing you just cant explain that many people think the bob lazar and tic tac ships are the same sort of ships which they probably are but you have to think about the origin of these objects bob lazar claims that he reckons the ship was found at a archeological dig but he doesnt know for sure the thing is the way they explain this technology like we dont know how to deal with it goes to show how could we take one down and steal it we probably couldnt hence why he thinks its a old artifact from the past now i dont think the fact he thinks its a old ship rules out that its possible because it still is very plausible think about it we have seen all throughout history depictions of tic tac shaped ships in the sky shown in art caves all of that that leavea me to believe we have been seeing these for a very long time the reason i believe this is becquse we mentally as humans have only been able to percieve whats around us a viking today that saw one whilst sailing the seas would not even be able to fathom the idea of aliens so its only been until now we are starting to understand them therefore making it possible to have a crashed ship from the past i think the main thing we need to take from this is that we are being lied to not one part of this makes sense and now we have media and the internet alot more people are coming oit and saying they saw things and alot of credible guys too people who are vouched for the way i see it even bob lazar was lied too he doenst know whats true and what isnt his base thoughts were derived from the governments briefing which also stated that the technology came from light years away in a random solar system now how the fuck would they know this they cant people say oh yeh maybe the government has technology that is more advanced that public technology which is probably true but nothing to the point of anti gravity ftl i think maybe the government have somehow established contact with this distant life form and maybe theres a deeper meaning for it maybe the government were threatened to allow them to do their business the government may have just accepted it and said sure because our technology is so futile compred to them because how else would they know where the objects are coming from let alone how theres reports of them constntly entering the planet and just roaming i dont think its possible unless we decoded info or contacted them somehow if you guys agree or disagree let me know this is basically my biggest interest right now lol
0,probabilities of something like sword art online with today s technology will we have any sort of system similar to the gaming headsets in sword art online in sao there were headsets that linked with your body and sent you physically into a virtual world of beauty in this world it was a virtual reality but with a kick instead of simply looking through the goggles like the oculus rift you would be put into an unconscious state when you logged onto the game you were actually there the emotions the senses everything worked within this game players could do just about anything they wanted so are we anywhere near this sort technology i ask because it seems like the virtual reality consoles are the next gaming systems for us is this world even possible or is it more of a thousand years into the future kind of tech

0,can an establishment presidential candidate lead society into a technologically efficient world that s disruptive to traditional beliefs it can be argued that the role of government is to maintain control over society one hopes that such control would be to promote security freedom and opportunity for its citizens establishing a mutually beneficial social contract between government and its citizens when society was primarily agricultural horse and plow farming rules and a money system consistent with that lifestyle and technology were used some moral and some not so moral in hindsight in the industrial age governmental control evolved and was effected mainly through the passage of new laws and the evolution of the financial system promote efficient exchange in a specialized labor world now that highly efficient and productive technology is rapidly advancing to eliminate the need for many to labor can traditional political and economic thinking especially in an era where funds must be raised from the established elite appropriately address the issues being created by highly disruptive technology if not then what venue can innovative thinkers collaborate to create and or suggest new rules and financial systems to advance and promote security freedom and opportunity for a better future society
0,the onus the burden or blame is consistently placed upon the consumers and the people of earth concerning the use of plastic containers and plastic packaging products when in fact the blame lies squarely with the manufacturers who use cheaper plastics in packaging instead of paper metal or glass consider also the lack of government oversight foresight to enable refunding programs for containers that could make conservation of plastics and glass a reality usually this lack of oversight is at the behest of the manufacturers who want to keep using cheap containers face it when you re shopping you don t care if you re carrying your groceries out in a paper or plastic sack and why would you care that your soup is packaged in plastic metal or glass short answer is you don t care as long as you get the product in good condition paper metal and glass are readily recyclable biodegrade well in the event of no recycling and the containers can be made to have a refund with little to no administrative oversight as most of the agencies required to perform and administer such oversight already exist the reason more sensible methods of recycling and ecologically friendly based packaging aren t used or don t exist is called profit and the only ones making it are the manufacturers and yes of course the earth continues to lose in the battle of profits versus the environment

0,the greatest problem facing neural networks today the greatest problem facing neural networks today is their lack of a good memory for any task it is crucial to be able to recall the best actions you took at any particular moment that is you should be able to recall in your mind at any given time all the actions you have taken during a task and how to apply them to the next it s hard enough for an experienced computer programmer or computer scientist to think of what they want to write in a programming language in their head and it would be much harder for a neural network if a neural network gets its memory working it would be able to write code and thus do much of what programmers do in this paper i present a way to do that with a neural network the idea is that by having the network do its own backtracking to remember where it has been it would be able to learn from its mistakes this would let them do things like play chess or improve their programming skills in fact we could see a future in which all ai development would happen in this way it can now perform some functions and can become a neural network a program that executes on a computer i call this idea the memory paradox this is not to say that the memory paradox is a proof of the correctness of ai or anything like that it s not that the memory paradox has something to do with the correctness of ai the memory paradox shows that a machine like neural network which learns what it does and remembers its experiences could be a program that executes on a computer it would be a program that knows how to code itself the neural net would also understand that programming is a process of finding the best program and then learning how to implement it so it s not surprising that the neural net would recognize the memory paradox in a particular example but that would have no bearing on whether ai was correct or not the memory paradox is simply a demonstration that the neural net doesn t understand how programming is supposed to work that was a long answer so i ll try to wrap this up quickly here are my answers to the most common objections to ai this isn t real ai i wrote this by feeding in prompts to the talk to transformer the first prompt i started with was the greatest prompt would be something that fuels the neural network the prompt would lead it to create a new theory or invent something not invented the greatest prompt is this response where is all of this coming from but what if the greatest prompt was the greatest problem the greatest problem you are a computer program you have been programmed to run on a computer system called a neuron you have a problem you are the best you are the fastest you are the most intelligent you are the most beautiful you are the best at anything you are the best at anything what do you do when you are the greatest you are going to go out and solve the greatest problem there is where is all of this coming from that s the great question but the neural network is not so i took the networks advice and my next prompt was the greatest problem facing neural networks today the response is the beginning of this post is this it
0,will technology eventually turn us into a super species when everybody is essentially perfect will we be more happy technology always has and always will change the world considerably from to we went from a species that was just starting to mess about with cars and planes to a species that has landed on the moon and has the worlds entire database of knowledge in their pocket one of the things i find most fascinating in regards to  and technology in general is the application that it has on the improvement of the human body robotics nano technology d printing and many other technological advancements all seem to have potential to have a profound effect on medicine and general improvement of our lives just think about all the things we read on this subreddit alone regarding topics such as artificial limbs or organs d printed ribcages nano technology being able to identify and hopefully one day kill cancer cells but why stop there what will eventually stop us from being able to completely alter our dna finding the cells that make us smart beautiful funny happy healthy etc etc and why stop even there why not go even further in the future where organic technology can turn everyone into a super athlete with supermodel looks with an einstein iq if nature doesnt kill us and we dont wipe humanity out ourselves will this be our inevitable future when there are no more dumb ugly unhealthy people will we as a society be happy if race is abolished and we all become this one general human being with perfect traits will that be the solution to racism to hate to war i find this absolutely fascinating because if nature or we dont set ourselves back i really see no other end game and hell why should we not take this direction or is there an underlying issue here do we need a balance in life that nature gives us by not giving everybody smarts strength or looks

0,the usa is going to fall very far behind other countries because they are teaching math the completely wrong way and have no plans on changing it this article on reddit caught my attention earlier it claims that the united states is losing its dominance because people don t like to learn math or are not effective at lowering math we will lose in the end when it comes to artificial intelligence the reason for this is very simple and i know it because of first hand experience we are teaching math completely wrong we don t believe that teaching a subject is a long term effort we instead teach subjects like you have one attempt or few attempts to learn it and if you are not grasping it then you are doomed to fail forever and it will not ever be possible for you to learn it that is how we are teaching mathematics and that is completely wrong in college you have to pay a lot of money to study math many schools have ineffective teaching methods leading to very low pass rates for classes and students are already paying for these classes based on debt we simply can t afford to retake the same math class several times just to master one class or portion of math that s just not economically possible for us when repeating any sort of course more than once the institution charges you extra fees that are sometimes very hefty so in essence they are penalizing you for repeating a course that s right in the united states you are penalized financially for not giving up so if it takes a student accounts to pass college algebra the basic level math course in college do you really think they are going to go on and learn calculus with enthusiasm and confidence there are three calculus courses so they would have to take these three courses three times each for a total of courses that would take about years since we count the winter and fall semester of college and you have to take the math classes in sequence this is of course a worst case scenario but i ve met and had classes with many students that have struggled truly struggled with math and had to retake a math class at least three times that costs about minimum because of the credit hours course fees and included online access textbook so taking math classes we re assuming that the student has to repeat some of the classes here would cost a whopping on top of their degree this is using figures fromthe cheapest community college you can find because it s about per credit hour imagine wanting to go to any school that actually teaches you effectively you can be looking at to just to add some math courses to your degree additionally after completing the absurdly rigorous mathematics course work of college students are so exhausted and infuriated by it that they never wants to touch math again and there are also no programs for continuing education after college to master mathematics taking calculus courses in college doesn t mean you re a master at mathematics quite the opposite it means that you are a novice and that you succeeded in cramming for math tests and passing them it doesn t mean that you re going to retain anything or even be able to effectively apply the concepts you just learned this is the wrong way to learn we should not be penalizing students for learning math with financial penalties we should not be allowing ineffective teaching of mathematics and it should not be a short sprint learning mathematics should be incorporated into our lives for the long term offering courses that are cheap effective and user friendly that helped us to want to be good at math currently we don t have this we go through this rigorous and stressful coursework in college that we barely even pass after spending or grand on it and then we graduate college and going to the workforce and never ever think about math ever again should be no surprise we are so limited in our growth with the above in mind it should be no surprise why the united states is inevitably going to fall behind we are not subsidizing people to learn mathematics we are penalizing them and not fixing the problem of ineffective teaching we need to make math not a short sprint but instead a lifetime learning experience for people

0,future modelling of time and experience i had an experience a year ago that made me come up with an interesting thought we in this forum can possibly come to an understanding that computers are getting stronger as time goes on one day computers will be so strong that a possible singularity will happen were unsure of when it will happen but that s not what this is about if a singularity happens then i imagine that computers intelligence will be able to model the universe very well i also believe that they would be able to model time what i m leading to is that humanity one day will be able to look back and see everything that s happened by reversing everything backwards it seems possible that they will be able to know what we are thinking too so there is a kind of irony that people are not aware of instead of fearing judgement from a god or gods it may be that the future is judging everything we do maybe not judging because the empathy levels would be higher in a more intelligent community i believe but more of history book that is very thorough it s just a thought a found interesting and maybe others will too thanks

the ones he himself said were wrong his main problem was trying to predict the consumer success of various technologies also don t be ultra pedantic about some wording like portable computer remember that he wrote all this in the mid s before terms like smartphone and cloud were common or even coined in fact i ve gone ahead and put some of these modern terms in there if it s obvious that s what he was referring to individuals primarily use portable computers portable computers will have become dramatically lighter and thinner than the notebook computers of ten years earlier personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry such as wristwatches rings earrings and other body ornaments computers with a high resolution visual interface range from rings and pins and credit cards up to the size of a thin book people typically have at least a dozen computers on and around their bodies which are networked using body lans local area networks for the most part these truly personal computers have no moving parts memory is completely electronic most portable computers do not have keyboards most users have servers in their homes and offices where they keep large stores of digital objects including their software databases documents music and movies digital objects such as books music albums movies and software are rapidly distributed as data files through the wireless network and typically do not have a physical object associated with them most users have servers where they keep digital objects such as virtual reality environments although these are still at an early stage there are services to keep one s digital objects in central repositories but most people prefer to keep their private information under their own physical control cables are disappearing communication between components such as pointing devices microphones displays printers and the occasional keyboard uses short distance wireless technology computers routinely include wireless technology to plug into the ever present worldwide network providing reliable instantly available very high bandwidth communication the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition csr dictation software but keyboards are still used csr is very accurate far more so than the human transcriptionists who were used up until a few years ago also ubiquitous are language user interfaces luis which combine continuous speech recognition csr and natural language understanding for routine matters such as simple business transactions and information inquiries luis are quite responsive and precise they tend to be narrowly focused however on specific types of tasks luis are frequently combined with animated personalities interacting with an animated personality to conduct a purchase or make a reservation is like talking to a person using videoconferencing except that the person is simulated computer displays have all the display qualities of paper high resolution high contrast large viewing angle and no flicker books magazines and newspapers are now routinely read on displays that are the size of well small books computer displays built into eyeglasses are also used these specialized glasses allow users to see the normal visual environment while creating a virtual image that appears to hover in front of the viewer the virtual images are created by a tiny laser built into the glasses that projects the images directly onto the user s retinas computers routinely include moving picture image cameras and are able to reliably identify their owners from their faces in terms of circuitry three dimensional chips are commonly used and there is a transition taking place from the older single layer chips sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three dimensional space this technology is based on creating audible frequency sounds from the spectrum created by the interaction of very high frequency tones as a result very small speakers can create very robust three dimensional sound a personal computer can perform about a trillion calculations per second supercomputers match at least the hardware capacity of the human brain million billion calculations per second petaflops unused computes on the internet are being

complexity theory computing although most computer computations are still done using conventional sequential processing albeit with some limited parallel processing autonomous nanoengineered machines i e machines constructed atom by atom and molecule by molecule have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls however nanoengineering is not yet considered a practical technology research has been initiated on reverse engineering the human brain through both destructive scans of the brains of recently deceased persons as well as noninvasive scans using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging mri of living persons and animals in the twentieth century computers in schools were mostly on the trailing edge with most effective learning from computers taking place in the home now in while schools are still not on the cutting edge the profound importance of the computer as a knowledge tool is widely recognized computers play a central role in all facets of education as they do in other spheres of life the majority of reading is done on displays although the installed base of paper documents is still formidable the generation of paper documents is dwindling as the books

computer of their own which is a thin tablet like device weighing under a pound with a very high resolution display suitable for reading students interact with their computers primarily by voice and by pointing with a device that looks like a pencil keyboards still exist but most textual language is created by speaking learning materials are accessed through wireless communication intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning recent controversial studies have shown that students can learn basic skills such as reading and math just as readily with interactive learning software as with human teachers particularly when the ratio of students to human teachers is more than one to one although the studies have come under attack most students and their parents have accepted this notion for years the traditional mode of a human teacher instructing a group of children is still prevalent but schools are increasingly relying on software approaches leaving human teachers to attend primarily to issues of motivation psychological well being and socialization many children learn to read on their own using their personal computers before entering grade school preschool and elementary school children routinely read at their intellectual level using print to speech reading software until their reading skill level catches up these print to speech reading systems display the full image of documents and can read the print aloud while highlighting what is being read synthetic voices sound fully human although some educators expressed concern in the early years that students would rely unduly on reading software such systems have been readily accepted by children and their parents studies have shown that students improve their reading skills by being exposed to synchronized visual and auditory presentations of text learning at a distance e g lectures and seminars in which the participants are geographically scattered is commonplace learning is becoming a significant portion of most jobs training and developing new skills is emerging as an ongoing responsibility in most careers not just an occasional supplement as the level of skill needed for meaningful employment soars ever higher persons with disabilities are rapidly overcoming their handicaps through the intelligent technology of students with reading disabilities routinely ameliorate their disability using print to speech reading systems print to speech reading machines for the blind are now very small inexpensive palm sized devices that can read books those that still exist in paper form and other printed documents and other real world text such as signs and displays these reading systems are equally adept at reading the trillions of electronic documents that are instantly available from the ubiquitous wireless worldwide network after decades of ineffective attempts useful navigation devices have been introduced that can assist blind people in avoiding physical obstacles in their path and finding their way around using global positioning system gps technology a blind person can interact with her personal reading navigation systems through voice communication kind of like a seeing eye dog that reads and talks deaf persons or anyone with a hearing impairment commonly use portable speech to text listening machines which display a real time transcription of what people are saying the deaf user has the choice of either reading the transcribed speech as displayed text or watching an animated person gesturing in sign language these have eliminated the primary communication handicap associated with deafness listening machines can also translate what is being said into another language in real time so they are commonly used by hearing people as well computer controlled orthotic devices have been introduced these walking machines enable paraplegic persons to walk and climb stairs the prosthetic devices are not yet usable by all paraplegic persons as many physically disabled persons have dysfunctional joints from years of disuse however the advent of orthotic walking systems is providing more motivation to have these joints replaced there is a growing perception that the primary disabilities of blindness deafness and physical impairment do not necessarily impart handicaps disabled persons routinely describe their disabilities as mere inconveniences intelligent technology has become the great leveler translating telephone technology where you speak in english and your japanese friend hears you in japanese and vice versa is commonly used for many language pairs it is a routine capability of an individual s personal computer which also serves as her phone telephone communication is primarily wireless and routinely includes high resolution moving images meetings of all kinds and sizes routinely take place among geographically separated participants there is effective convergence at least on the hardware and supporting software level of all media which exist as digital objects i e files distributed by the ever present high bandwidth wireless information web users can instantly download books magazines newspapers television radio movies and other forms of software to their highly portable personal communication devices virtually all communication is digital and encrypted with keys available to government authorities many individuals and groups including but not limited to criminal organizations use an additional layer of virtually unbreakable encryption codes with no third party keys haptic technologies are emerging that allow people to touch and feel objects and other persons at a distance these force feedback devices are widely used in games and in training simulation systems interactive games routinely include all encompassing visual and auditory environments but a satisfactory all encompassing tactile environment is not yet available the online chat rooms of the late s have been replaced with virtual environments where you can meet people with full visual realism people have sexual experiences at a distance with other persons as well as virtual partners but the lack of the surround tactile environment has thus far kept virtual sex out of the mainstream virtual partners are popular as forms of sexual entertainment but they are more game like than real and phone sex is a lot more popular now that phones routinely include high resolution real time moving images of the person on the other end despite occasional corrections the ten years leading up to have seen continuous economic expansion and prosperity due to the dominance of the knowledge content of products and services the greatest gains continue to be in the value of the stock market price deflation concerned economists in the early years but they quickly realized it was a good thing the high tech community pointed out that significant deflation had existed in the computer hardware and software industries for many years earlier without detriment the united states continues to be the economic leader due to its primacy in popular culture and its entrepreneurial environment since information markets are largely world markets the u s has benefited greatly from its immigrant history being comprised of all the world s peoples specifically the descendants of peoples from around the globe who had endured great risk for a better life it has the ideal heritage for the new knowledge based economy china has also emerged as a powerful economic player europe has been somewhat quicker than japan and korea in adopting the american emphasis on venture capital employee stock options and tax policies that encourage entrepreneurship although these practices have become popular throughout the world at least half of all transactions are conducted on line intelligent assistants which combine continuous speech recognition natural language understanding problem solving and animated personalities routinely assist with finding information answering questions and conducting transactions intelligent assistants have become a primary interface for interacting with information based services with a wide range of choices available a recent poll shows that both male and female users prefer female personalities for their computer based intelligent assistants the two most popular are maggie who claims to be a waitress in a harvard square caf and michelle a stripper from new orleans personality designers are in demand and the field constitutes a growth area in software development most purchases of books musical albums videos games and other forms of software do not involve any physical object so new business models for distributing these forms of information have emerged one shops for these information objects by strolling through virtual malls sampling and selecting objects of interest rapidly and securely conducting an on line transaction and then quickly downloading the information using high speed wireless communication there are many types and gradations of transactions to gain access to these products you can buy a book musical album video etc which gives you unlimited permanent access alternatively you can rent access to read view or listen once or a few times or you can rent access by the minute access may be limited to one person or to a group of persons for example a family or a company alternatively access may be limited to a particular computer or to any computer accessed by a particular person or by a set of persons there is a strong trend towards the geographic separation of work groups people are successfully working together despite living and working in different places the average household has more than a hundred computers most of which are embedded in appliances and built in communication systems household robots have emerged but are not yet fully accepted intelligent roads are in use primarily for long distance travel once your car s computer guidance system locks onto the control sensors on one of these highways you can sit back and relax local roads though are still predominantly conventional hilariously kurzweil himself says this isn t just wrong but ten years off let s wait and see what will bring us a company west of the mississippi and north of the mason dixon line has surpassed a trillion dollars in market capitalization privacy has emerged as a primary political issue the virtually constant use of electronic communication technologies is leaving a highly detailed trail of every person s every move litigation of which there has been a great deal has placed some constraints on the widespread distribution of personal data government agencies however continue to have the right to gain access to people s files which has resulted in the popularity of unbreakable encryption technologies there is a growing neo luddite movement as the skill ladder continues to accelerate upwards as with earlier luddite movements its influence is limited by the level of prosperity made possible by new technology the movement does succeed in establishing continuing education as a primary right associated with employment there is continuing concern with an underclass that the skill ladder has left far behind the size of the underclass appears to be stable however although not politically popular the underclass is politically neutralized through public assistance and the generally high level of affluence the high quality of computer screens and the facilities of computer assisted visual rendering software have made the computer screen a medium of choice for visual art most visual art is the result of collaboration between human artists and their intelligent art software virtual paintings high resolution wall hung displays have become popular rather than always displaying the same work of art as with a conventional painting or poster these virtual paintings can change the displayed work at the user s verbal command or can cycle through collections of art the displayed artwork can be works by human artists or original art created in real time by cybernetic art software human musicians routinely jam with cybernetic musicians the creation of music has become available to persons who are not musicians creating music does not necessarily require the fine motor coordination of using traditional controllers cybernetic music creation systems allow people who appreciate music but who are not knowledgeable about music theory and practice to create music in collaboration with their automatic composition software interactive brain generated music which creates a resonance between the user s brainwaves and the music being listened to is another popular genre musicians commonly use electronic controllers which emulate the playing style of the old acoustic instruments e g piano guitar violin drums but there is a surge of interest in the new air controllers in which you create music by moving your hands feet mouth and other body parts other music controllers involve interacting with specially designed devices writers use voice activated word processing grammar checkers are now actually useful distribution of written documents from articles to books typically does not involve paper and ink style improvement and automatic editing software is widely used to improve the quality of writing language translation software is also widely used to translate written works in a variety of languages nonetheless the core process of creating written language is less affected by intelligent software technologies than the visual and musical arts however cybernetic authors are emerging beyond music recordings images and movie videos the most popular type of digital entertainment object is virtual experience software these interactive virtual environments allow you to go whitewater rafting on virtual rivers to hang glide in a virtual grand canyon or to engage in intimate encounters with your favorite movie star users also experience fantasy environments with no counterpart in the physical world the visual and auditory experience of virtual reality is compelling but tactile interaction is still limited the security of computation and communication is the primary focus of the u s department of defense there is general recognition that the side that can maintain the integrity of its computational resources will dominate the battlefield humans are generally far removed from the scene of battle warfare is dominated by unmanned intelligent airborne devices many of these flying weapons are the size of small birds or smaller the u s continues to be the world s dominant military power which is largely accepted by the rest of the world as most countries concentrate on economic competition military conflicts between nations are rare and most conflicts are between nations and smaller bands of terrorists the greatest threat to national security comes from bioengineered weapons bioengineered treatments have reduced the toll from cancer heart disease and a variety of other health problems significant progress is being made in understanding the information processing basis of disease telemedicine is widely used physicians can examine patients using visual auditory and haptic examination from a distance health clinics with relatively inexpensive equipment and a single technician bring health care to remote areas where doctors had previously been scarce computer based pattern recognition is routinely used to interpret imaging data and other diagnostic procedures the use of noninvasive imaging technologies has substantially increased diagnosis almost always involves collaboration between a human physician and a pattern recognition based expert system doctors routinely consult knowledge based systems generally through two way voice communication augmented by visual displays which provide automated guidance access to the most recent medical research and practice guidelines lifetime patient records are maintained in computer databases privacy issues concerning access to these records as with many other data bases of personal information have emerged as a major issue doctors routinely train in virtual reality environments which include a haptic interface these systems simulate the visual auditory and tactile experience of medical procedures including surgery simulated patients are available for continuing medical education for medical students and for people who just want to play doctor there is renewed interest in the turing test first proposed by alan turing in as a means for testing intelligence in a machine recall that the turing test contemplates a situation in which a human judge interviews the computer and a human foil communicating with both over terminal lines if the human judge is unable to tell which interviewee is human and which is machine the machine is deemed to possess human level intelligence although computers still fail the test confidence is increasing that they will be in a position to pass it within another one or two decades there is serious speculation on the potential sentience i e consciousness of computer based intelligence the increasingly apparent intelligence of computers has spurred an interest in philosophy computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible woven into our clothing embedded in our furniture and environment computers will tap into the worldwide mesh aka the cloud what the world wide web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating web servers thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks of high speed communications and computational resources we ll have very high bandwidth wireless communication to the internet at all times displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas similar tiny devices will project auditory environments these resources will provide high resolution full immersion visual auditory virtual reality at any time we will also have augmented reality with displays overlaying the real world to provide real time guidance and explanations we ll have real time translation of foreign languages essentially subtitles on the world we ll have access to many forms of online information in our daily activities virtual personalities that overlay the real world will help us with information retrieval and our chores and transactions these virtual assistants won t always wait for questions and directives but will step forward if they see us struggling to find a piece of information
0,the way to survive ai is to have multiple ai if in the future we create a superintelligent ai this entity would likely quickly take over control especially in our digitalized world a good strategy to counter this risk however is to create multiple ai s in effect a single ai would have a monopoly position meaning it can abuse its customers but if you have multiple ai then you can play them against each other forcing them to be nice to humans or we will flee to another ai now there s the risk that these multiple ai s might adhere to the game theory and play nice with each other so they can control us but then it might be easier to just use game theory in regards to humans and be nice to us as well either way this will end in either humans fusing with ai or becoming extinct the human species needs to evolve and adapt to our new digital surroundings or we will become another failed nature experiment edit we re already seeing this tendency to create multiple ai as many companies are working hard on them and ever increasing their focus google apple microsoft facebook china the risk is that whoever gets it first might choose to launch a pre emptive strike to take out the competition while it s still weak

0,my idea for a utopian future so i ve had this idea for a utopian future for some time and i ve described it to a few of my friends and received mixed feedback i recently became privy to this sub and it seems the perfect place to have a discussion of my idea and so here i am it strikes me that currently as a species we are making huge advancements in the fields of technology and computing ai and robotic manufacturing capabilities have been improving at an incredible rate as well and i feel that relatively soon ish years we will be at a point where the entire production process for all goods can be fully automated this would have several implications both economic and social economically we would see the cost of everything fall dramatically cost is more or less a reflection of human labor involved in manufacturing a product if a product requires many hands and much time and oversight it will be expensive because all those workers need to be paid if the product is produced entirely by robots the cost is nearly zero and the product could be free if everything was made for free everything could be sold for free now you have a situation where nobody works in industry but all goods are free and so you can live comfortably with no income because everything you need you can get for free at this point we could get rid of money but what about services that could only be provided by a human like a lawyer or a psychologist you ask well we would still have roles like those in our society but they wouldn t be paid why because they don t need to be paid because they can exist for free at this stage we would have a world where there would be no economically imposed limits on anything unlimited medical research unlimited r amp d for nasa unlimited r amp d for bettering our automated production system anything that could be done could be done to its fullest potential because it could be done for free i think that this future is not only a beautiful utopian world where anybody can fully dedicate themselves to whatever they wish but also a world that is becoming ever increasingly likely due to our continued advancements in technology feedback tl dr everything is free everything is wonderful

0,discussion are you guys excited about automation technology causing job loss it seems every other day someone posts something about some technological societal advancement that s causing people s jobs till become redundant while that s the inevitable truth how many sword craftsmen are left the world i have two issues with this first i m excited as any of you about progress i get goosebumps thinking about how different the world i die in will be from the one i was born in ideas like extended life spans technological breakthroughs the blurring of organic and artificial life are awe inspiring what i don t like is the glee that some of the posts here exhibit about the loss of jobs yes it seems silly for people to be going repetitive manual labor but losing their jobs means families losing their bread earners people too old to retrain becoming unemployable i find that part tragic second its a little short sighted to assume that these jobs will disappear it s like when robotics were introduced into manufacturing yes many jobs were lost but the change was gradual and it created many more adjacent jobs either directly like robot maintenance or indirectly where the demand for these kind of things opened the programming and engineering jobs today my point is that there will always be more problems to solve than people to solve them and that s what a job is about sure the immediate concept of a job is to accomplish a task or produce something but the overall goal is to solve problems in short there will always be enough jobs for those willing to and capable of building up the skills for them

0,enhancing animal intelligence now i am by no means an expert on science or biology but i have been entertaining this idea of increasing animal intelligence for some time now amp i would like to know what other people think similar to movies such as deep blue sea or planet of the apes i wonder why don t we increase the brain functionality of other species of course las in the movies there are drawbacks and potential dangers right definitely but i think that it would be beneficial not only for the species themselves but for humans also smarter animals better chances of species survival how do we expect certain species to adapt to an ever growing mechanical and technological world where human interaction and interference becomes more common for instance game fishing smarter fish make them harder to catch hunting amp poaching endangered species learn and adapt faster thus somewhat leveling the playing field population control as the population grows and we are able to create more resources and better medicines life expectancy and birthrates will rise this would create more families which would need more land and space for living farms schools etc smarter animals may find a way to integrate however more preditorial creatures would help delineate the barriers where humans should not encroach the world would become a more dangerous place and perhaps rightfully so as the stewards of this planet it is our moral imperative to not just remove ourselves from the darwinian paradigm but all the creatures on earth as well our journey to a post biological post darwinian state will be a mutual one idk these are just a few things that ive been thinking about i would love to see smart ass tigers laying siege to some small town in kansas or something like marauders or elephants learning how to use stealth or some shit it would be fuckin awesome humans would have to level up even more thoughts
0,there s a flaw in simulation hypothesis the hypothesis basically claims that if the simulations which we are building are getting more and more realistic then it maybe possible to create lifelike simulation indistinguishable from reality and if it is possible to create such realistic simulations then we maybe in one as well the problem with this claim is that the simulations are not getting realistic for the beings inside them but they are only getting realistic for us the creators of the simulation therefore we can not draw the conclusion that we maybe fully simulated ourselves the only way we could create simulated universes would be to create virtual reality type simulations and plug ourselves in it which would mean that we are not simulated in the first place ps i have tried to post this viewpoint on various subs trying to start a discussion on the topic but nobody has responded to my comments so i am trying it here to see if there are people who would like to discuss about this if there is a better sub for these kind of discussions please let me know

0,the freedom of knowledge can unleash our future s potential if we reorganize society so experts are free to pursue solutions then the problems you pay for won t continue just for the power and profit of the few we re confronting a future whose potential has wildly different outcomes either technology will allow people to have the economic freedom that allows us to define how we use our time or it will give the elite the power to control everything we do if we want progress in society to match the innovations of technology then we need the freedom of knowledge to act as the bridge between them the powerful and the rich depend on the same problems that cost us money so that they can justify taxation and ever increasing fortunes solutions that save us money are against their personal interest and the current system gives them the influence to delay innovations that would be much cheaper or free for us to fix this glaring conflict of interest we must achieve the freedom of knowledge so that our institutions of knowledge research and education are independent a reform to guarantee that our future s potential isn t held back for power and profit of the very few we have so many experts with the knowledge to solve challenges but they are controlled by people whose expertise is in winning elections or making profit true independence with the freedom of knowledge allows us to harness these experts in a way that benefits everyone s lives in three major ways it encourages our economic freedom by making sure that rich interests can t interfere with the kind of research that improves quality of life for us but infringes on profit for them think delays to renewable energy as a glaring example and apply that to automation medicine finance transportation etc by harnessing people from other fields of knowledge like law philosophy journalism politics and others we can have a system to gather news and information about what s going on in government and the wider world identify corruption and so boost political freedom and most ambitiously the freedom of knowledge is a goal that can unite us across borders so we can begin to overcome our most dangerous threat our division inequality and the threat of warfare by coordinating people and resources to achieve a future that benefits all but with the potential for so many benefits there is still a major concern independence means being in control of their own funding so the public must participate in making these decisions but that leaves open the risk for the same corruption as found in politics but this is the pursuit of knowledge it not about personal views and self interest but information reason and evidence these concepts make open and transparent leadership easy especially with the internet where decisions are explained out in the open with evidence and instead of dividing voters by location they might be organized by knowledge education career expertise so representation reflects different modes of thought to compare differing perspectives success depends on your support for a grassroots movement to push for this reform so it s lucky that the internet exists to coordinate such an ambitious effort the first step is to develop the network that can plan the social organization to achieve this reform so that we can work out any kinks before taking responsibility for public institutions of knowledge support lies in its appeal for uniting humanity in pursuit of economic and political freedom goals that resonate with most people across the planet this is a dense topic and this post is for reaching out to people open to this idea so i hope you re one of them i created r adorners so you can read a series of short essays that further explain how the freedom of knowledge can work our future has an intimidating set of obstacles and this goal is meant to rally people around the most reasonable reaction possible to both support this reform but also to add new ideas whatever support you offer we just hope that you realize how hard it will be without your help

0,with the rise of china as a superpower are you worried at all about countries adopting the china model of authoritarianism and becoming as totalitarian as china that s what worries me because someday i m sure all of us will share the same fate as the north koreans and chinese mainlanders and i m sue the nations of the world will adopt labor camps and reeducation camps made legal by the un because of china s influence over them to throw us in for wrongthink or for having a low social credit score since the social credit system adoption will come first what a time to be alive when you grow up with ideals of freedom and democracy only to live your adult and elderly years under a totalitarian state your own country having turned on you and deeming you the enemy

0,don t you think now is not that different from the past as you expected when you were a child this is not a serious thread but just a light rant all right i have not contributed anything to the advancement of any technologies so it is not that i am blaming others but it is just that now is not the exiting future i was expecting in the s if i could somehow show the current world to s myself s myself would not be that surprised and probably understand most of the new things in a day or so without much astonishment far from the s i saw in tv shows of s in short everything other than computers got just slightly better and even for computers they just got faster so things that we already knew how to implement but could not have done so due to processing speed are now possible but other than that computers are not different from s cars look more or less the same the do have some small gps guidance device but it is not that surprising or magical there are not k i t t like cars or hovering cars most of them are still driven by humans and using petroleum i have heard of self driving cars but i cannot imagine when a fully automatic cars that you do not have to drive at all will be of the price of current cars there are no human like robots no google assistant does not seem to have a human like a i i have a google home and it feels to me that it just a very complicated and long if else programming than it actually understands me even at a year old child level it does not understand or respond like a human it says the same things over and over again it does not understand even a simple question if it is an unusual question that the engineers in google did not expect i have lowered my expectations and am using it mostly just for simple things like asking time weather setting timers houses look the same refrigerators microwave ovens washing machines look the same there are some smart ones with just basic wi fi capability but in my standard they are still dumb and they are not even prevalent there are not so many diseases that were impossible to cure in the s but now are curable i mean we still die from cancers dentistry is still using drills we still cannot even eradicate simple viruses like herpes that hide inside our body ray kurzweil predicted a fundamentally different world in years from now i can hardly believe it yeah he says acceleration of changes but it feels more like an excuse i kind of expect the year would not be that different from now other than we have some faster smaller computers

0,anybody else think there s a future in the gig economy right now i think the gig economy is a natural prototype emerging i don t think it s really matured to the point where it s sustainable but i believe it will as conventional jobs begin offering more part time work than full time jobs and people will have more side hustles until those become sustainable jobs especially with the assistance of new technology aside from our current ride and room sharing whatever there will be more private chef delivery services that provide better food at a lower cost than fast food instead of going to a crowded and expensive bar you go to a crowd funded party where you donate for a party invite or two maybe instead of paying for a new couch or any new furniture you hire a craftsman with the tools know how and creativity to provide a better custom product for less same might go with fashion or any other product that is tailored to personal taste i think education will get so expensive and unsustainable well connected professors could theoretically open their own schools and teach classes at a fraction of the price but without the expenses of bureaucratic accreditation for those that cannot afford tuition there might be apprenticeship programs to replace grants and scholarships the biggest obstacle is petty nanny state bullshit about zoning limited business licenses and other bureaucratic nonsense that will bring the hammer down once they realize they ve been sidestepped corporate interests will lobby the govt to enforce this bullshit even harder because regulations are used to protect them from start up competition at a certain level but there is a built in solution and that s democracy i think there could be open source alternatives to current prototype services like uber that allow the users to make democratic collective decisions rather than some smug ceo that s only interested in snorting the profits up their nose these cooperatives could run ahead of the regulatory curve by providing a superior service with the highest standards and customers would flock to that kind of brand or we could continue on the same outdated capitalist socialist structure and deny the reality of the unsustainable collision course we re on

0,energy discussions stop pushing nuclear power here s why there seems to be a very shallow amount of information circulating about nuclear power and it seems every energy discussion includes a number of people espousing the benefits of nuclear power please allow me to briefly outline the issues with nuclear power procurement nuclear mining is a specialized kind of mining the amount of nuclear ore in a particular rock formation is very low so it s mined using a crushing and chemical wash which separates the materials so it takes a buttload techincal term amount of rock and this rock is extracted and ground up which shoots tons and tons of radioactive dust into the air tons of it tons of radioactive dust the chemical treatment produces a sludge waste radioactive waste mind you which is then dumped into a waste lagoon obviously these lagoons will hold for several million years until it s contents stop being super radioactive and never leech their radioactive contents but wait there are many that have failed spilled into rivers and so on most of these mining operations are remote and in countries with very lax regulations so anyway then this crudely refined nuclear product shows up gets refined some more and viola we get power and the generators are safe well yes in general they are the odd natural disaster does make them unsafe on occasion but overall they re safe the procurement is not not not safe it seems so many people believe that just because the plant is safe everything about nuclear power is safe this is mostly just a very successful bit of marketing generated by things like pr men standing in front of giant nuclear cooling towers with a geiger counter and shrugging but is patently false now storage the storage of spent fuel is still not something people have solved once the fuel is spent it is still radioactive for a couple million years the fuel rods are then encased in a substance traditionally it was glass and placed in some container with moderate dampening qualities to handle the radioactivity at least best case scenario this happens but even the very best storage solution is at best unknown but more likely inadequate turns out it s really hard to design something to last million years or even or even years with much certainty that it will not fail so the question of what to do with this pile of nuclear ruble continues without a clear solution only that hasn t stopped production so the pile grows and grows it is insane which brings me to my last point so many things are better solar wind thermal etc etc we live in a world of amazing new technologies that can already easily cover our energy needs so why continue with this obviously destructive technology i hope this has helped inform some of you out there and i hope we can leave the world a little better than we found it

0,wait but why gives a glimpse of what the following decades could look like with regular mars trips and it s beautiful link to the blog post the part that i found particularly exciting upcoming mars oppositions and what spacex is planning for each july send a dragon spacecraft the falcon s suv size spacecraft to mars with cargo october send multiple dragons with more cargo december maiden bfs voyage to mars carrying only cargo this is the spaceship elon wants to call heart of gold january first people carrying bfs voyage to mars let s all go back and read that last line again january first people carrying bfs voyage to mars did you catch that if things go to plan the neil armstrong of mars will touch down about eight years from now and zero people are talking about it but they will be the hype will start a couple years from now when the dragons make their mars trips and it ll kick into high gear in when the big fucking spaceship finally launches and heads to mars and lands there everyone will be talking about this and the buzz will just accelerate from there as the first group of bfs astronauts are announced and become household names admired for their bravery because everyone will know there s a reasonable chance something goes wrong and they don t make it back alive then in they ll take off on a three month trip that ll be front page news every day when they land everyone on earth will be watching it ll be all over again this is a thing that s happening elon doesn t like when people ask him about this first voyage and the neil armstrong of mars he says that it s not about humanity putting a new multi planetary feather in its cap and he s quick to point out putting people on the moon was super exciting but where s our moon base in other words having humanity give mars a high five for bragging rights is not what matters what matters is carrying out the full vision of actually creating a full self sustaining civilization on mars and yeah sure fine but i m excited for it s gonna be so fun anyway so then the next mars opposition will roll around in this time if everything stays on track multiple bfs s will make the trek to mars carrying more people than were in the original group in and the spaceship that went over in the space mayflower will make its return trip to earth carrying some of the first group of mars pioneers back home they ll return to massive celebration as international heroes and the legendary spaceship will head off to enjoy its life in the air and space museum meanwhile we ll all be glued to the tv as the group of bfs s arrive on mars where the people in them will continue the grueling work started by the group the early colonists will have a hard job like early colonists always do and this will be extra hard not only will they have to truly start from scratch digging mines and quarries and refineries constructing the first underground village habitat with the first martian hospitals and schools and greenhouse farms laying down a giant plumbing system to pump water into the village building that first rocket propellant plant but they ll have to do all of this in a place where they can t go outside without a spacesuit on and where everyone and everything they ve ever known is on a pale blue dot in the night sky it ll be hard but for the explorers of our world the payoff may be worth it elon says you can go anywhere on earth in hours there s no physical frontier on earth anymore now space is that frontier so it ll appeal to anyone with that exploratory spirit in april of spacex will send an even larger group of spacecraft people and cargo to mars this time it ll probably get less attention by we ll probably be getting used to the idea that there are people on mars and that every months a great two way migration occurs the growing mars colony will continue to entice the adventurers those who read about the great sailing exhibitions of the th and th centuries and yearn to be there when i asked elon about how the small colony will grow and evolve he said think of the mars colony as an organism that starts off as a zygote and then becomes multi cellular and then gets organ differentiation so it doesn t look exactly the same all the way along any more than the first settlement in jamestown wasn t representative of the united states today it ll be the same with mars mars will be the new new world the and and oppositions will bring substantially more people to the new new world by this point the budding martian city will be a part of our lives we ll follow the twitter feeds of some of our favorite journalists on mars to keep up with what s happening there we ll all get hooked on mars s first hit reality shows and some of us will start thinking should i sign up to go to mars one of these years before i get too old by there will be over a hundred thousand people on mars the company your son works for might have a branch there and he ll be saying goodbye to a couple co workers who are about to head to the planet for a month stint he tells you that he doesn t want to go because he doesn t want to take his ninth grade daughter away from her life and her friends but he says she s applying to a program that would bring her to mars from the ages of to for an urban planning degree you worry even though you know it s irrational it s just that you remember the days when going to mars was risky and dangerous and some part of you is still uncomfortable with it and what if she decides not to come back by the early days of mars seem primitive during the first few mars migrations only a few spaceships made the trip with only people in each it was prohibitively expensive to go it took three months to get there and there were only a few very grueling industries on mars to work in in every mars opposition sees over ships make the trip each carrying over people and a couple thousand tons of cargo half a million people make the journey every two years and about less than that come back because earth to mars migration capacity grows a little bit each time as more ships are built the trip which now takes only days costs only in dollars and most people just pay off the ticket price with their well paying job on mars labor is in high demand as the early mars cities continue to expand and new cities are built many people remember those early days of the mars colony when it was all about spacex funded by spacex or their cargo clients and driven by their ambition and their ingenuity and their guts but now dozens of companies specialize in earth mars transit and hundreds of companies focus on development and entrepreneurship on mars and transit is paid for like planes and trains and buses are paid for today by passengers buying tickets a decade later the migration brings the mars population above a million people small celebrations break out around both worlds as a long awaited landmark is achieved most people though don t even notice

0,wouldn t we have preference modification happen before a dyson is sphere is ever needed it is very likely that humans will learn to be content with what they have long before a large project like a dyson sphere is needed we have reward mechanisms which regulate our behaviour and we have biotechnology which can eventually manipulate those reward mechanisms a goal oriented organism will likely have a way to identify a state of affairs that is beneficial to it and a reward mechanism could trigger to tell it to do whatever it did again to bring about that state an organism with enough control over it s own system could hijack the reward mechanism or hijack the mechanism with which it identifies a beneficial state of affairs a human can either do drugs or play video games if such an organism could engage in preference modification what is more likely that they would point their preferences towards something that is difficult to accomplish or something that is easy to accomplish i would say that if i were to modify my preferences i am more likely to survive if i need and want fewer resources than if i need and want an entire star and i would be able to modify my preferences long before i would be able to build a dyson sphere

0,incentives the ultimate significance of blockchain will blockchain subvert the modern company system what is the significance of blockchain technology in the future why can bitcoin be hyped for over ten years and still have such strong vitality it is impossible to know what the future world will look like without studying these issues in depth the cornerstone of decentralization from monarchy to republic planned economy to market economy both have proved a history of decentralization and the cornerstone of decentralized development is the incentive mechanism from the vast history of humankind it is not difficult to see that those very successful countries must have created more advanced incentive mechanisms for example the joint stock company a social incentive mechanism that changed human destiny once created the first marine empire the netherlands the dutch east india company considered to be the first truly joint stock company in humankind reached its peak in with a market value of trillion u s dollars nearly seven times higher than apple once the shareholding company was created on the earth the hype over stocks began to be rooted in human genes in the british nanhai co ltd was established by the share price of the south sea company had risen from at the beginning of the year to more than in july the speculators included more than half of the lawmakers and even the king could not help but tempted to subscribe for shares worth pounds of course the stock price of the south sea eventually broke falling from more than to around we call it the south sea bubble isaac newton also participated in this hype and expectedly ended up losing a lot i can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people isaac newton although the south sea bubble burst the rise of joint stock companies in britain has brought great strength to its colonial expansion and the industrial revolution later france learned it soon in it adopted a similar approach to the united kingdom and gave the mississippi company the right to sell stocks by mid the stock price of the mississippi company had risen for consecutive months and the stock price had risen from the river rose to more than ten thousand rivers an increase of more than times but mississippi s stock price eventually broke down in and finally fell back to rivels history has called the mississippi bubble in the th century the united states began to rise and there were endless bubbles in rubber company stock prices and railway company stock prices in the th century the u s manufacturing stock price bubble broke out including ibm and texas instruments which can drive the price earnings ratio to more than times within a year but fell back to times a year later in the s another high tech stock bubble burst in the united states apparently the rise of a country is accompanied by the birth of a new incentive mechanism or the high use of certain incentive mechanisms as an inevitable hype the rise of the netherlands was accompanied by the prosperity of the shares of the dutch east india company and the birth of the world s first stock exchange in amsterdam the colonial expansion of the united kingdom and france and the industrial revolution were accompanied by the stock price bubbles of the south sea and the stock prices of joint stock companies such as the mississippi bubble and then the development of joint stock companies the united states has become a world hegemon where it has been accompanied by stock price bubbles again and again however except for shareholding companies is there any other incentive mechanism for the development of the human economy blockchain may provide a different answer the reason why joint stock companies have a strong incentive mechanism is that in the past years humans have mainly focused on production problems it requires a strong system to stimulate production joint stock companies make capital and professionals more relevant combining with the national law as a guarantee the monarch cannot override the law so that those who own the shares can continue to obtain benefits this form of shares has become an unchallenged consensus in the market mobilizing the entire market to invest resources all its potential on the other hand suppose that the shares you own may be deprived of violence at any time who would be willing to invest and who would desperately risk innovation therefore the creativity stimulated by the shareholding system has caused mankind to stagnate the economic aggregate for thousands of years and began to rise linearly many people think that this is the credit for the industrial revolution but the industrial revolution itself has not separated from the main body of the company however since the development of the human economy its needs have changed although human needs for material are still very strong there is greater demand for distribution systems and new incentive mechanisms that break national boundaries joint stock companies can still play an important role but behind a joint stock company is the state which is a specific or even exclusive legal system if the guarantee of a specific legal system is lost the stock will lose its wealth attribute and the incentive mechanism will be invalid the blockchain will further promote the logic of the shareholding system the blockchain can allow the subject matter of equity to exceed the limits of specific countries that is it can be transferred and bought and sold without the protection of any national law undisputed consensus system for example the subject matter of blockchain equity such as bitcoin has reached a global consensus and has produced incredible incentives the price bubble is similar to the various stock price bubbles after the birth of the shareholding system indicating a new arrival of incentives it can be said that the blockchain we understand now is just a technology so it is still very narrow in terms of its development and use this was like the east india company the south china sea company and the mississippi company at that time it was used only for the government and the king to solve debt problems and distribute wealth from colonial robbery it did not expect the role of the shareholding system in the history of human development

0,a book which predicts what life would be like in the future has been reprinted after attracting a cult following but how hard is it to tell the future geoffrey hoyle is often asked why he predicted everybody would be wearing jumpsuits by he envisioned a world where everybody worked a three day week and had their electric cars delivered in tubes of liquid these colourful ideas from his children s book living in the future helped prompt a facebook campaign to track him down his work has now been reprinted with the year in the title amended to i ve been criticised because i said people would wear jumpsuits explains hoyle the son of noted astronomer and science fiction author fred hoyle we don t wear jumpsuits but to a certain extent the idea of the jumpsuit is the restriction of liberties hoyle s book is a product of its time the move towards a planned society with an emphasis on communal living colour it most of it is based on the evolution of a political system hoyle notes the author also predicted widespread use of vision phones and doing your grocery shopping online he is one of a long line of science fiction authors to have tried their hand at  the discipline of mapping out the future if you go back over the years in terms of science fiction and fantasy you find many very brilliant simulations of futures that have occurred says richard rhodes author of visions of technology a century of vital debate about machines systems and the human world perhaps one of the most celebrated pieces of  by a science fiction author was arthur c clarke s prediction of a network of satellites in geostationary orbits effectively remaining at the same spot in relation to a fixed point back on earth the idea of satellites in geostationary orbit had been floated before but clarke was the first to see the possibilities for their use as relays for broadcasting and communications and hg wells was years ahead of his time predicting nuclear weapons in and later inspiring physicist leo szilard in more recent times author david brin in the novel earth and in his other works predicted citizen reporters personalised web interfaces and the decline of privacy the top method is simply to stay keenly attuned to trends in the laboratories and research centres around the world taking note of even things that seem impractical or useless says brin you then ask yourself what if they found a way to do that thing ten thousand times as quickly powerfully well what if someone weaponised it monopolised it or commercialised it enabling millions of people to do this new thing routinely what would society look like if everybody took this new thing for granted conscious efforts at  go back a long way in to celebrate its th anniversary the new york times went to several prominent men for their predictions of what life would be like in there were hits william mayo predicted a plus year lifespan other predictions about an ageing population and less importance for national boundaries were promising a similar exercise had been undertaken in looking forward to for the columbian exposition in chicago florida as a major tourist destination and fast trains are among the hits but there are many misses politician john j ingalls was one of the most prescient when he wrote about travelling from new york to london in less than a day predictions failed or successful tell us as much about the time they were made as they do about the future go back to the early years of the cold war and predictions of catastrophic nuclear war were widespread it is the dog that didn t bark says rhodes also author of the twilight of the bomb in the nuclear community in the years after world war ii they were pretty clear if we didn t eliminate nuclear weapons if they didn t get it under control there would inevitably be a nuclear war they didn t see the deep existential fear those weapons induced in leaders of the various countries and it s easy to get things wrong or to miss a potential development because an insurmountable obstacle seems to stand in the way one common wrong prediction made by utopian socialists in the th century and cropping up in and and many times since is the idea that mechanisation just has to go a bit further to earn us all a life of leisure hoyle s three day week for has failed to materialise people are going to have to work very hard it s gone the other way people are working seven days a week i m very pessimistic now he says but hoyle got it right when predicting the role of the vision phone and the vision desk sounds rather familiar too the glass on top of the screen is made in a special way so that when you write on it the camera photographs what you write if you predicted today that within a few years time key electronic devices like phones gps and media players would be embedded in the human body you would hardly be saying anything daring it s fairly straightforward to extrapolate from existing technology that tends to be what people do says rhodes but the really important changes are almost inevitably complete surprises the proliferation of the computer and the microchip comes into this category says tim mack president of the world future society computers were all looked at as big data crunchers says mack people missed that the embedding of chips in just about everything  is big business now the defence industry picked it up a long time ago but now it s used in everything from consumer technology to food firms

0,confirmed we live in a simulation ever since the philosopher nick bostrom proposed in the philosophical quarterly that the universe and everything in it might be a simulation there has been intense public speculation and debate about the nature of reality such public intellectuals as tesla leader and prolific twitter gadfly elon musk have opined about the statistical inevitability of our world being little more than cascading green code recent papers have built on the original hypothesis to further refine the statistical bounds of the hypothesis arguing that the chance that we live in a simulation maybe the claims have been afforded some credence by repetition by luminaries no less esteemed than neil degrasse tyson the director of hayden planetarium and america s favorite science popularizer yet there have been skeptics physicist frank wilczek has argued that there s too much wasted complexity in our universe for it to be simulated building complexity requires energy and time why would a conscious intelligent designer of realities waste so many resources into making our world more complex than it needs to be it s a hypothetical question but still may be needed others such as physicist and science communicator sabine hossenfelder have argued that the question is not scientific anyway since the simulation hypothesis does not arrive at a falsifiable prediction we can t really test or disprove it and hence it s not worth seriously investigating however all these discussions and studies of the simulation hypothesis have i believe missed a key element of scientific inquiry plain old empirical assessment and data collection to understand if we live in a simulation we need to start by looking at the fact that we already have computers running all kinds of simulations for lower level intelligences or algorithms for easy visualization we can imagine these intelligences as any nonperson characters in any video game that we play but in essence any algorithm operating on any computing machine would qualify for our thought experiment we don t need the intelligence to be conscious and we don t need it to even be very complex because the evidence we are looking for is experienced by all computer programs simple or complex running on all machines slow or fast

information density the new device belongs to an emerging class of electronics called memristors which store data using resistive switching
0,how much time do we have untill climate wars start we all know there will be massive climate disaster soon we already see it i wonder if i will live to see full blown conflict or not maybe i can prepare recently i saw science graphs about major weather factors changing like glacial thickness temps etc but those great scientists didnt metion consequences maybe they ommited them on purpose i wonder what will set off first massive exodus of populus which will be first step to war will it be rise of sea level or heat i know heat will force poor ppl to travel to another counters then rich will come with tanks to grab some space from other countries so how long till arabia becomes inhabitable for rich also how long till all ice melts from north and south caps

0,do you think we will attempt to terraform mars and to what extent do you think such a feat is even possible i for one do believe that terraforming other worlds is extremely possible we are in a sense terraforming earth as we speak just in a negative direction toward ecological collaps true terraforming obviously refers to making a planet of ecosystem more hospitable for life but i think my point remains that being said i foresee a number of issues when discussing the viability of mars as a potential planet for future terraformation projects many of these issues are not at all insurmountable some may be i do however think people will attempt to terraform mars anyway once we have a permanent colony on mars which seems extremely likely to come to pass within the next years i think the next logical steps will be for those colonists to try to work toward colonial independence from earth part of that effort i believe will be a push toward terraformation my question for you guys is do you also believe there will be a push to terraform mars either from colonists or from outside sources and if so do you think it will eventually be successful why or why not

0,a future vision of a matrix style existence without ai some people can accept simulation theory and since shamanism allowed shamans to astral travel and nasa cannot inner space may be the next frontier but in this vision of the future we will assume we live in the matrix and have purchased a colonization package for our own simulator which we will say is like a flying saucer but all computer and we will be consciousness cams by then that attach to smith bodies and are physically immortal able to change bodies in a transporter so a far future vision of people who live in the matrix under more favorable circumstances since they are users and owners and run software themselves so an airship in a hangar that is attached to the ceiling and projectors in the balloon area project film onto the inner surface of the hangar so that the scenery moves and looks real since the imagery is mapped onto a curved white surface and that is in a hollow moon with a titanium hull and just there on some tarmac keeping in mind that computers can create engineering objects like that any hi res film can be used then the airship is used for command and control of your new galaxy which you obtained and have rerouted from the galactic console to your airship so that you will not be using ai but rather automated systems like reset so environmental reset twice a week no dishes to do and the beds are made and no cleaning or grass to cut not even at golf clubs or parks you enter and exit through the transporter which is a stargate door and the pc in the airship has door positioning software and all that does is connect coordinates since this is a digital simulator and the galaxy is being used for ram and disk space and a universal block of spacetime is created so you can copy and paste your planets and moonships onto the grid and connect stargate doors merely by connecting coordinates in a universal coordinate system so the transporter works on handprint and iris scan where needed and single entry and the doors are addressed along with this the transporter has a cupboard like a kitchen cupboard and that connects to the library of cupboards and in any kitchen on the system once you make an entry into the library there normally since you just got back from shopping through there so you enter the goods into the library and then using your iphone or any device like that you merely select the item and the kitchen cupboard you want it to appear in and it is copied and pasted from a paused storage world all of this type of technology is made possible not by writing a great deal of matrix code but by taking advantage of the fact that computers get backed up and can restore they can be partially backed up and partially restored that is copy and paste reset is also restore for the humans the brain object is identified in the code and memories are not stored in the body so the body can be reset at any time and people can stay young and healthy forever and the equipment resets so it stays new forever and only the virtual machine itself the simulator with its billion year power contract will cause it to stop and that can be renewed for another billion always there would be a contract because to be immortal forever and never be allowed to die would not be right either so along with this wonderful system backups of the earth are made stargates placed on them when it is restored onto a blank planet and you enter with a suitcase full of money and so that is your form of entertainment and yes groundhog week day year alternate history and so many other games would be possible preventing your boredom and removing the need for you to have a large empire that you need to babysit and that would maybe try to overthrow you and your airship although it doesn t matter who turns you into a battery we worry about the ai more than dr evil

0,forecasting the future as a series of races against time a british tory politician in the s once said our job is to hold on to power until the labor party regains it s sanity i like to think of the future that way there are gradual forces that will improve things in the long run and our job is to hold things together as best we can until those forces come into play some examples technology versus environmental degradation eventually we will develop sustainable clean energy sources and clean manufacturing the question is can we hold off the worst environmental effects long enough for that new technology to come online liberal democracy versus authoritarianism for much of the th century the us and the uk were the only stable open societies on the planet they hung on and democracy is now well established over most but not all of the planet is that race over knowledge versus religious ignorance knowledge is gradually displacing religious ignorance and intolerance but there are still parts of the world and parts of the us that are in the grip of dangerous and unpredictable religious extremism will we keep those forces at bay long enough for them to dissipate what do you think of these races and what other races will play out over the next years

0,my commentary about this article serving the billion unbanked a new trillion dollar market here is the article roughly years ago we stopped hunter gathering and began farming this to me marked a technological singularity even though it may have taken a a good years to unfold still the world after the advent of planned agriculture was like nothing that ever existed before yes some people still hunter gathered but they became the minority in short order so anyways this farming busines apparently produced so much food that an excess of food not needed for survival came about this became the rule not the exception famines not withstanding humans being the clever folks we are began to see other things they could do since they were getting their food with no additional effort so some started making jars and stuff to keep the grain in i wonder how long it took us to come up with successfully making a jar i imagine that we already were making music had some kind of medicine man and already had some kind of adornments going on like necklaces and whatnot when enough food was available we began to specialize one person got really good at making music another got really good at healing the ill that same healer dude was also starting to make a form of true science too religion and belief on top of things that actually seemed to help like willow bark religion and belief persisted for as long as it has because it worked and it also somewhat predicted what the future would bring sounds like a theory to me if you take my meaning prior to the holy man i imagine we were scared of everything thunder and lightning volcanoes and earthquakes big animals big people and death i always wonder what prehistoric native americans thought about tornadoes it probably took about as long for religion and beliefs to form as science did today from the year ohh whenever thales was there had always been an alpha male in hunter gathering tribes but with the advent of farming the leader now began to take on semi religous aspects as well he was the intermediary between the powers and us i wonder how long it took us to come up with abstractly attributing powers to literal forces of nature like wild animals and stuff he still ran things but it was a lot more responsibility now overseeing justice and protecting us against other farmers who wanted our land and livestock and wimmen and verily people gave him all kinds of nice things and wimmen so anyways the guy making the jars liked the work of the guy making the necklaces he said i ll give you some jars for one of them necklaces and there may have been some haggling but eventually a bartering deal was reached this was the birth of value something you wanted but had to work to get it became wildly unbalanced because some humans are very clever while others are not at some point we started writing all this stuff down to keep track of things slashes and marks and circles i m told this eventually evolved into cunieform or some such then the egyptians prettied it up like crazy and somewhere along the line phonetic letters simpler to make than a picture of a kneeling guy came along like egyptian demotic and that weird minoan i think we still can t translate even with supercomputers and ai then greek and so on somebody came up with the idea of using a little piece of something easier to carry than a bunch of jars to represent a barter object and the medium of exchange was born i wonder how long people carried ten million jars around on donkeys and wagons before somebody said this for the birds and let me tell you there was some seriously weird mediums of exchange but eventually clever humanses settled on metals that were fancy like silver and electrum you had to make electrum too and gold and whatnot it did not take long before both clever and cleverly devious humans came up with ways to amass amazing amounts of mediums of exchange and i m sure that interactions such as banking and investing existed long before double entry bookkeeping was a thing long before banks and investing were a part of the historical record so anyways all of this evolved into the mess we have today of massive financial inequality i will admit of all the economic systems that capitalism was extraordinarily beneficial to the common man it brought us the fabulous s after all the humans are still clever and cleverly devious they just have lots more examples from history to draw from and ungodly powerful supercomputers hell goldman sachs has a quantum annealing computer i imagine that it is making them pots full of money unsmiling older white males do not like losing money trust me they are making massive profits and as you can clearly see capitalism for the common man has gone sour because things always continue to evolve and now we face a very novel problem so the industrial revolution took about years to replace human and horse and oxen muscle plenty of time to generationally adapt but even then there were some catastrophic problems this time we are not replacing muscle we are preparing to replace the human mind when you replace the human mind and the human muscle it leads to a scary combination like vehicles that can drive themselves from point a to point b with no human mind or muscle intervention newspaper articles that can write themselves with wit at the push of an automation button drug research that can take months instead of decades and of course clever ai that gets smarter by the day i read just the other day that attempts to bring about higher mininum wage are forcing ever faster adoption of ai robotics and automation so fellow amp humans are not at the top of the amp priorities and the employ of a massive number of humans is going to be gone with the wind in less than years time and the ai robotics and automation is going to snap up any new methods of employment we come up with the usa government says perhaps those displaced by technological advancement can be retrained i ll just let a beat go by so you can think about that and it s dazzling logic i said all that stuff that came before to say this we are approaching the time that ai robotics and automation can make anything from starting at raw materials to finished product today we can make a diamond that is molecularly indistinguishable from a naturally mined blood diamond in fact debeers is now selling the manmade diamonds the diamonds identical to real for dirt cheap alongside their mined blood diamonds the point is to make the would be suiter ashamed to buy a manmade diamond when truly mined blood diamonds are available for about ten times the price and thus he demonstrates true love and devotion to his intended by purchasing the artificially inflated price mined blood diamonds what a scam damn i m glad i m anyway that was to demonstrate that goods and services are even today possible for if not free then for massively reduced prices i see the electric level autonomy sdvs as a very low priced subscription service as yet another example of our coming post scarcity world but the big thing is this idea of things being worth massive amounts of money when they are already cheaply produced simply because the person selling can get away with it like fifty dollar apirin ten capsules on your you ll never see itemized hospital bill we need to change the way we think we have to evolve our ideas of how people can live comfortably without money and still attain the most important need of self actualization but a year habit is hard to break but we have to the only other choice is societal upheaval if that were to happen i think it wouild go like this the amp with ai robotics and automation and most importantly technicians scientists and engineers in their hardened bunkers would be safe from what comes to pass for you the first sign that the upheaval has taken place would be the instant and permanent cessation of electricity and water perhaps accompanied by emps to render all vehicles and other small electric devices permanently innoperable within months about percent of usa citizens would be dead of violence or starvation there would be enclaves the ai used by the amp would send modified short time viral vectors into the enclaves on drones the size of houseflys some work by humans would still need to be done and the surviving humans would be glad to exchange their services for whatever bone they can get but eventually the ai robotics and automation would render them superflous as well the amp with a goodly number of highly specialized humans would then go forward into a magnificent future of ai robotic and automation comfort and affluence and scientific immortality awesome vr and ai enhanced minds and robot wimmen here is a scary fact if today amp of all of humanity were to suddenly disappear the earth would have the population it had in the year seventeen days after george washington passed away i think those unsmiling now year old looking old white men would like that just fine the earth a paradise and not too crowded only the best of the best ready to face the awesome future of the universe you and me long gone that is societal upheaval i hope that post scarcity works ubi is pointless always has been lucky people getting it in experiments it could never ever work societally this knife edge future filter if you like is about ten years away now here is hoping for post scarcity

0,impact of gaming upon the society axonvr amp xb i put that link in the beginning and most of you probably are quite aware of the rig but it seems quite clear where the gaming is going towards i think that is the coolest form for virtual reality because rigs where people use their feet like on a treadmill doesn t seem to function that well it s a shame that in ready player one they didn t use a concept of axonvr however the point of this writing is that i m quite sure that the system will be similar but the joints that keep the person in air with the exoskeleton or haptic suit will twirl and twist depending on the actions of the person of course we are quite long way from it or it probably needs quite much sensors upon the body still if we ponder upon the structure it s quite obvious that the rig or the joint will twirl and twist and also come to be a loading deck so that people can disconnect and use the haptic suit in ar of course also the haptic suit can be used upon labor as well because it s also an exoskeleton but also it would seem quite possible then to use vr to control robots in real life because that would be quite obvious also i think that s the eventual concept until it s possible to do controlled hallucinations via machines upon the brain amp xb slightly off topic i ponder a lot about the social impact because in this world there are games that are already pay to win and the mobile gaming industry has come to be quite a huge market it would be interesting if a consumer could play the game for a year to get an item and then someone whom would work would get the same item in couple of months think it as a world of warcraft with many many players and where you can actually feel of riding a dragon mount in the sky of course also the exoskeleton and the robots controlled through vr are interesting because a person could take a loan of and then just play a game of building structures without the need for manual labor in sense the problem however is what would happen if some would make a game that is free for all a community based game amp xb of course i might be a bit out of my league and i think that probably all companies from microsoft to sony and from google to facebook have thought the same concept but it s quite clear the loading deck of vr to make people use the suit in ar but it s such a strange world people fighting imaginary skeletons in streets with them feeling the sword of the skeleton upon themselves and in vr people flying with dragons in photo realistic realities amp xb sorry if this came to be a bit of a mess but i usually just write with the flow of consciousness because there is a lot to ponder but if people here are capable of doing things with these kinds of technologies then i would also recommend to rent football yards stadiums parks etc and put them as g playing zones i think cameras connected through cloud with augmented reality glasses are the beginning of the whole scenario that children play in parks with augmented reality glasses and games like counter strike doom perhaps not doom but that there are obstacles which look like a map of counter strike etc perhaps there could be objectives like get this ball to the other side of the map and the ball would look like some kind of nuclear device and with death a person would have to run back to the beginning in the respawn area i just believe in g zones in the beginning because of privacy and i think it s a collaboration of cameras and augmented reality glasses through the cloud computing dunno i just wanted to write this because i m quite bewildered about the future

0,do any of you ever feel like you re the only optimist in a world of pessimists and people thinking the status quo is all we re gonna get so i was having a drawn out discussion with some of my buddies online a few minutes ago and we got to the topic of scientific progress i brought up potential treatments for cancer and possible methods of human colonization of space and space travel in general as a response they just laughed at me and started memeing about how unrealistic everything scientific is from nuclear fusion to advanced ai it just feels like i was the only one there willing to believe that we re still just scratching the surface of science and that there s still so much left for us to discover i want to believe that there s a much better future in store for us if we push for it rather than just giving up and saying this is the best it s ever gonna get but a lot of these people don t feel that way they believe that we ve hit our technological plateau as a species and that is about the best we ll ever get i bring up space colonization and they bring up how bad the iss is and how we ll never get past those issues i bring up fusion and they talk about how it ll never happen it s just so depressing do any of you feel that sometimes you re the only one who believes in a brighter future and that we re still just starting to unlock our technological potential

0,agent learning ownership of the body parts of the same agent from humans and dogs to ai so i was walking at the gym and this question arose in my mind how do i know the body parts i am seeing are my own the neural network in my brain must have acquired that association at some point in my life if we assume that no humans are born with such information and in contrast to humans some dogs and cats try to catch their own tails in such cases extending the assumption to animals in general it follows that the tail chasing behaviors result from the brains of the animals not having learned the association from these two observations i thought about what the difference between the two is then i noticed this humans can easily see their bodies while it is more difficult for the cats and dogs to see their tails now if we have a drone with two arms and an eye so that the drone can actually see its arms would it learn that its arms are its own and more directly if we build an artificial neural network and feed it the video of its abstract layout with all the related information such as the associated weights would it learn that the circuit images are of its own
0,is automation stealing jobs from kids an essay oc is automation stealing jobs from kids we like things easy this is especially easy to say in developed nations not so much in poorer countries to achieve the utmost ease we have made innovations in the home which make our lives way easier and give us the freedom of time not to mention the freedom from physical labor which has lead to fatter and fatter humans but like i said i won t mention it there are three appliances in the home which stand out as being mostly automated two are ubiquitous the washer dryer and the dishwasher nearly every home has these things it s something most people don t even think about the third is quickly catching up as it sweeps the world with its popularity the roomba the automated robotic vaccuum cleaner just press a button and let it explore every square centimeter of your floor plus it ll give your cat or newborn child a free uber ride to the next room gone are the days of washing clothes in the backyard with a huge metal tub and a hauling out the old washboard so what do we do we take the dirty clothes shove em into the washer until a sock won t fit then we add detergent and start it up only to be forgotten for three days and the clothes smell sour if only the washer would dump the clothes into the dryer the same goes for dishwashers scrub a pot after casserole night with the dnd bros eff that just run it through the wash and if there are still bits stuck on run it again what s water anyway as a bonus i ll throw in the lawnmower because i saw one at gerenic giant box store the other day that has all wheel drive all wheel drive your honda fit will be useless when the snow comes but you can strap a chair to the other honda in your garage and ride it to the corner store for that subzero slurpee and you can earn a few bucks on the way cutting a walk path down the street if only the trash compactor sprouted wheels and dumped neat cubes of trash at the end of the driveway amirite the end result here is that these tasks are no longer the incredible hassle of bygone days so what do kids have left to do chores were a big part of growing up and usually it was the way to earn an allowance all these tasks have become so easy we are taking jobs away from the children isn t this how the u s proletariat feels about jobs and robots so what chance do the kids have to earn an honest buck the answer is that the kids still get their allowance they just don t have to do as much or work as hard for it they are entitled to it it would seem ugh nasty word that but they are entitled and they get their allowance and free time and all these nice perks which we don t think about because they are kids all this thanks to innovation and automation hopefully from this point it s easy to make the leap to the global landscape it won t take long to explain it s the same thing crappy arduous repetitive tasks are automated and humans benefit it does feel like the jobs are being taken away but that s a fallacy which is bred by ignorance yeah i m calling you ignorant but it s with love it s also partly perpetuated by bad people in power so they can keep making money but that s just classic greed the truth is most jobs in the future will hardly be jobs it ll be supervision over machines and that will become remote supervision and that task in itself will be spread amongst several people so that time spent will be very low per capita super low instead of working hours like we have done forever even before hours were used as a measure of labor we will be working maybe ten hours a week for six months out of the year that s a hypothetical but it s highly likely we each do our specialised gig for a bit and some other dude takes over while we hop on the automated rv and watch netflix on the way to the grand tetons or robocon doesn t that sound nice what about the money i know you re asking that what about the allowance right well we still get that see the thing that costs the most is labor so you work a little bit and do your part for society and you get rewarded for it but you also have your ubi universal basic income things won t cost as much and you ll have a nice allowance to get the things you need get it because we ll be entitled i mean we ll probably still have to mow the lawn and load the various washing machines but i hear they re working on gps mowers and who says a washer can t also be a dryer one wonderful side effect of this is those poor countries i mentioned earlier will be able to skip all the mess of industrialization and capitalism and they ll join the rest of the world in a quasi utopian equality what is keeping us from achieving the entitled future disconnect and politics big money we are all disconnected in the sense that we have a hard time thinking past our political parties beliefs are one thing but logic and practicality are another if someone there in front of your face is in danger or needs help right away you re not going to first ask them who they voted for you re going to help and you probably won t miss the cheeseburger you dropped to run to aid it s because humans are naturally good at the instinctual level it s preservation of the species survival it s the easy thing to do the hard thing to do is fight and argue and bicker all the time that s hard that takes effort it s easy to just be nice to the human next to you and like i said we like things easy so let s be fat together

0,how many significant nation states do you expect to be created on mars there is the utopian idea that when humanity colonizes mars it will do so as a united humanity and the resulting societies whatever their differences of origin and local priority will be far more similar than they are different is that actually justified western countries will undoubtedly form democratic states in their martian colonies china russia and other societies will likely form oligarchic states in their colonies is it not reasonable that mars and all other celestial bodies colonized by human beings would have a mixture of different ideological viewpoints in the formation of their governing states and that these fault lines would be relevant both on the body itself and in relations with terrestrial nations so while science fiction has found it convenient to assume that there will be a mars a ganymede a callisto as unified political entities is it not far more likely that there will be nation states dividing these bodies and forming more abstract trans planetary alliances

0,so i have this idea for a future economic system that would need some thorough fleshing out but i wanted to share the basic idea is that there are two forms of credits intrinsic credits and earned credits intrinsic credits are of unlimited supply to all people and really are never counted these credits are used to buy things like food shelter education and medical care things that are essential to human survival and development earned credits are received when you provide a service whether essential or nonessential to another person so everyone who provides food to someone or gives them a tattoo or whatever receives some amount of credits these earned credits are what you use to spend on nonessential services like tattoos or video games this system would allow every person to purchase what they need to survive regardless of their situation in life it differs from an unconditional basic income in that you don t get free money because the free money you do get is only to pay for essentials the biggest thing i m trying to abolish about the current economic system is inflation things would not be valued by supply and demand but rather have established values and the supply would merely be what was available on a first come first serve basis there would probably have to be some regulation on the supply so as to not wipe out anything for the future but inflation is an incurable disease of the current economic system like i said it needs to be fleshed out in order to be a viable alternative to the current situation but it s an idea comments suggestions questions

0,only click on this if you have a very good idea of what entropy is also a warning really long post does nobody think throughout history everyone has had an idea of how the universe works how it began and how it will end but everyone has been proven wrong only modern theories still standing but these theories have not existed for long how can we truly say we are right especially when these modern theories compete someday we will likely have completely new theories and who knows if they might violate conservation of energy allowing humanity to exist pretty much perpetually but we just confine ourselves to a limited view ignoring what might be plus even with the current theories entropy is just the statistical thing that makes it so that stuff gains more order leaving less energy available it is technically possible for a candle to get hotter increasing the energy available and putting entropy in the system in reverse it just is extremely extremely unlikely because of how big a candle is but on a subatomic scale it happens all the time if given two subatomic to molecular batteries with the exact same amount of energy putting the system in a state of perfect entropy it not unlikely for them to fluctuate putting more energy on one side if you had a machine that could detect this change then when it does detect the change the machine would know it is statistically likely for the energy to move back to a state of perfect entropy or at least closer and since all of our energy is harnessed through the energy in space with a state of high energy moving to a space with a state of low energy entropy e g when a piston in a car causes an explosion in the chamber creating a state of high energy which pushes the piston because that energy wants out into the state of lower energy that is the air you could theoretically generate electricity from this likely movement thereby generating electricity from nothing

0,the self where to draw the line what i m about to talk about isn t a new idea it s tough to find truly new ideas anymore but we can still find ideas that are new to us which is basically my attempt in writing this to bring some old ideas into the current light i don t have all the answers which is why i ve selected the discussion flair i want to hear what you think about these ideas which have been floating around in my head for some time now everyone in the world has a sense of self the sense that this body i inhabit and the mind which houses my thoughts is essentially my self many people much more intelligent than i have tackled this concept carl jung had some things to say about the conscious and subconscious parts of the mind he talks about things like the ego the persona the shadow the anima of men s minds and the animus of women s minds he talks of something he calls the process of self individuation which at least as i understand it is the process someone goes through in their life as they begin to integrate the different parts of their self which may be hidden or repressed from the conscious aspect of the mind as an example as to how this happens and to show a small part of self individuation i will use a story about myself my father was an alcoholic and an angry one at that i was when i finally was able to get out of the house and for those years i developed a strong resentment and hate for my father and all of the things he did namely drinking and expressing anger in any form because of that i did everything in my power to cut myself off from these two things i never expressed anger towards anyone even in situations where a certain level of anger would have been the proper response i was prone to the occasional outburst of anger when i just couldn t hold it back any longer i feared the day someone truly made me angry because i didn t know what i would do to them i was afraid i would harm them beyond repair it wasn t until i stumbled upon the words of jung that i began to think more deeply about doing this to myself jung says that you must learn to utilize every part of your self to cut yourself off from a wealth of emotional energy like anger sexuality sadness and even happiness if through certain circumstances you ve deemed it as something you don t deserve or as something fundamentally useless you do yourself a disservice it would be like building a house with only ths of the bricks required and wondering why it s structure is compromised unless you learn what it is you ve cut yourself off from and learn to channel that emotional energy instead of letting it control you you re operating at ths of your potential strength bear with me i promise i ll bring all of this back to the title the self where to draw the line but first i have to put all of the pieces in place now what about the physical self it obviously plays a massive part in forming a whole self despite theories on us becoming an ai copy of ourselves it still won t be our current self no hormones will exist in that new form no blood will course through its veins no micro biome in its stomach which brings me to the next interesting thing we ve learned your body isn t just your body it is home to thousands of microorganisms which if you decided to cut yourself off from and eradicate from your body you would most assuredly die so let s just say for now your self is the collection of the conscious and subconscious parts of the brain as well as the cells that form your body and brain including the microorganisms that perform fundamental internal functions for your body and brain now what is the fundamental drive of all of these parts which call itself a self self preservation and self propagation we eat drink sleep and learn new things in order to make ourselves better at preserving our self and to make ourselves more attractive as a mate in order to preserve our species this is the point where we go into the point of where do we draw the line if the self s main drive is self preservation and propagation then why in extreme circumstances do we find ourselves making the split second decision to jump in the way of a car to save a stranger or run into a burning building to save a stranger why would we die for our children to live or for someone else s child to live that s not individual self preservation in that moment we decide it is not me who matters but the whole the whole self i m here to say that i believe we are all one is there a difference between taking the time to remember some old skills you used to have when you were younger and asking someone to remind you how it s done is there a difference between learning a new skill to serve yourself and providing someone the means to educate themselves so that you can also benefit from their mastery do you have anything to lose when you view everyone as an extension of yourself my gain is your gain your gain is my gain and together we grow so i ask again where do we draw the line is there or was there ever a line what do we have to gain from drawing lines between peoples cultures genders sexes creatures of the earth and lines within our own minds and hearts

0,how likely do you guys think it is that google and others are closer to strong general ai than they let on and that they are intentionally slowing research because of the existential risk ai poses i don t think is idea will be well received because everyone on this subreddit myself very much included loves the promise of ai but as much as we are taken by ideas about ending death poverty etc we have to pause and think rationally about the existential risk that ai poses i think that the development of strong general artificial intelligence is a moral imperative but i also believe that to create such a machine before the control problem has been solved would be pretty irresponsible no one is more aware of this than the people who are actually working on ai it s like nick bostrom says in superintelligence no blueprint for developing ai exists but if it did he wouldn t publish it in his book because he wouldn t want that kind of potentially dangerous information getting out there so is it possible that google is intentionally slowing research to allow work on the control problem to catch up also if you re interested in the control problem the problem of making sure we can control ai check out r controlproblem

0,in depth discuss and provide conjecture about the arrival of general purpose robots with brittle ai non agi in the home and workplace within the next years currently the best models for general purpose robots seem to be baxter and his little brother sawyer robots that are general purpose but are still somewhat limited especially in actual mobility asimo by honda is a mobile robot that is still pretty stiff but is starting to get to a useful point and is able to move around and perform some simple actions i believe that agi artificial general intelligence itself is a ways off but in the meantime something that will could be amazing is a general purpose humanoid robot that can handle a variety of tasks that can be uploaded to its memory basically taking a form factor similar to asimo the spatial teachability of baxer and some form of open source learning collective basically thingiverse but for robot tasks for the initial deployment a general purpose humanoid robot may be slow as hell but a robot that takes hours to do laundry then days to weed a yard is still an amazing tool it doesn t have to be fast it just has to get the job done and cost a reasonable amount for purchase maintenance and power costs and insurance if it s working out in the yard what are the challenges we face to seeing an affordable general purpose mobile robot without agi in the relatively near future say the next years how feasible is it extend that to years same question
0,in a solar system wide human civilization where would the richest and most powerful society the capital of humankind be located this is not actually as totally speculative as you might think there are plenty of objective physical criteria that can produce pretty convincing arguments for instance the relative balances among quantities like abundances of raw materials surface accessibility of those materials access to energy which principally means sunlight but can include some other forms access to other societies low fuel energy cost of traveling to and from it now you might object that we don t know what technologies will exist in such a future civilization but consider this no matter what the technology a freely available resource is still economically superior to something you need creative engineering to produce if all else is equal this means we can treat technology as a constant and just ignore it focusing simply on what location has the best balance of the positions listed above it would be fun to explore each general location s profile in turn but for the sake of brevity i ll just get to my conclusion and argue where i think the center of solar system civilization will ultimately be the saturn system raw material abundances large number of moons with a lot of water ice and organics vastly surpassing what s available on earth s surface but also considerable metallic resources among captured asteroids the total abundance is less than the jupiter system but more than the other two gas giants and the other factors will show why it s superior to jupiter as a general location surface accessibility to materials its large number of moons are mostly smaller and lower gravity than the jovian moons meaning cheaper to land on and then leave again within the system ice and organics are right there at the surface to be harvested and saturn orbit is an easier place to work with than jupiter orbit because there is much lower radiation access to energy obviously the closer to the sun the better and jupiter does have that advantage over saturn but it s not so far as to be trivialized as with the other two gas giants since fusion power is a prerequisite for colonizing the outer solar system at all the abundance and accessibility of deuterium around saturn could compensate for its greater solar distance transit to other societies saturn is centrally located in the solar gravity well as the well known xkcd comic illustrates and would be well positioned to benefit both from whatever stored energy or other resources flow outward from the inner solar system and the large quantities of raw materials that would flow inward from the outer gas giants and far flung kuiper belt destinations fuel energy cost of transit it s much cheaper in energy fuel to enter and exit saturn orbit in the area of its major moons than to do the same around jupiter and physically a lot closer to jupiter the asteroid belt and the inner solar system than destinations farther out are so it s energetically cheaper to go there cheaper to enter orbit cheaper to land on a moon cheaper to leave that moon and cheap to leave saturn altogether than the same ops for galilean moons of jupiter would be and those advantages would add up saturn s also just incredibly beautiful so people will want to live there other destinations are beautiful too but may be more of an acquired taste jupiter is let s be honest kind of menacing looking uranus and neptune are amazing in their own way but definitely less distinctive you may ask why the saturn system would be more economically attractive than say the asteroid belt the answer is economic density it s anchored by a planet while the belt is strewn across a vast volume that while cheap in energy to navigate being gravitationally equipotential or close to it would be diffuse and take longer for anything to happen and the exact opposite is why the jupiter system would have a relative disadvantage because it s anchored by too much of a planet its major moons are too much moon and three of the four are embedded in heavy radiation callisto is probably still going to be a great place to be but just not eventually as rich and dynamic as whatever ends up happening around saturn and here s another reason people will be able to visit the actual planet saturn in atmospheric craft because its gravity at that depth is actually about g same as right here whereas to visit jupiter s atmosphere you would have to endure g which would be extremely hard to escape just from a rocketry perspective people will also be able to do this at uranus and neptune but saturn is the closest gas giant that humans will be able to directly experience if any economic utility were found for that capability that would be decisive even if the rest were not so i hope this discussion is fun and stimulating
0,on reddit people who have interest in  could collaborate and help design a new narrative to expand security freedom and opportunity everywhere on this planet i live in a very wealthy neighborhood where most have lots of physical security freedom and opportunity because they or their parents have lots of capital many can take vacations whenever they want pursue the hobbies of their choice and pay others to do essentially anything they want further they don t have to concern themselves about the condition of others or the people they pay to labor for them although some have to labor for capital many do so in high paying jobs that can easily be replaced by technology especially the people in financial services in fairness to the current narrative a good argument can be made that capitalism spread more wealth to more people than any system that preceded it but still much of the world s population were left behind after the rules changed in and the capitalists were bailed out by governments those without capital were given relatively little and had to beg borrow and labor for capital just to survive but now with modern technology the need to limit freedom security and opportunity to those with capital is obsolete we can upgrade the rules and open opportunities up to everyone on this planet for example online education can teach unlimited students from anywhere in the world vr can open up access and opportunity in many areas that were closed in traditional brick and mortar capitalism indoor farming and new technology can sustainably give everyone food security new methods of construction can offer safe housing to everyone in short life can improve for everyone with new technology and new thinking history has simply been a volatile narrative of expanding wealth and opportunity to more people as technology advanced capitalism was by far the most productive system in an era of specialized labor and machines now that machines are increasingly able to operate with very little or no labor capitalism and limiting wealth to capitalists is becoming obsolete it is time to create better rules and a better system to sustainably spread security freedom and opportunity to everyone on this planet there is no reason for human progress to stop at traditional capitalism in an era increasingly dependent on sustainable global collaboration will people call those against spreading sustainable freedom to everyone terrorists while support those trying to improve the narrative everywhere regardless of their nationality or religion we live in exponentially growing times where access to opportunities is opening up and  is becoming one of the most dynamic and important subjects in history good futurologists must never limit their thinking to the narratives of the past because current problems can t be solved with the same thinking that created them freedom is a fundamental right and belongs to everyone who believes in others having the right to freedom as well the time has come for new thinking to expand security freedom and opportunity everywhere to levels never seen before in human history what would it take for the world to come together and collaborate to reboot and upgrade the global operating system

0,if humanity s ever growing population is negatively impacting the environmemt does it make sense to cap population growth i am by no means an expert on the environment the global economy populations or any such matter however it seems to me that many of the negative impacts on society come directly from a ever growing human population the growing population requires more food more land to live on more energy to keep warm at night etc if the population decreased would demand for such things also decrease wouldn t it help the environment would capping population growth by mandating a child policy across the globe have positive impacts on the environment would there be any negative impacts on the diversity of human life countries with restrictions on family size seem to catch a lot of flack for these laws however it seems logical to me humans are harming the planet so less humans for a while might have the opposite effect

0,would you like this future the end game essentially the end game is a theory i came up with that describes our future i will start with the end game and move toward the present so the end game is that every person will finally have freedom from time what i mean by freedom from time will be explained let start by thinking about the possibilites of living and earning income without actually working currently the average person whether they are salary or hourly earn income by trading time for money literally this means that a person must trade time of their limited lifetime for money and in order to live comfortably we need money in essence i am saying we are servants to such a system in the future we may evolve from this system due to robots really robots you say well the future of smarter and smarter machines tend to reason that eventually ai will be as good and then better than we are at completing tasks so it would mean good business to rather own your own robot and have it earn you income in the same way you did i am pretty sure humans would fight to say that we should make income from our working properties and we would unionize in a sence of saying it is the same as if we were working in order to earn the same hour income what seems to be the underlying difference between a rich person and not one freedom of time i would define a rich person as the following a person who could retire at any moment and live comfortably for the rest of their lives thats it so in the future i forsee a balance of humans owning robots and earning income from them an ongoing income where we are not doing any of the work would mean we could have our time back another forsight i have is that this would lead to an era of task oriented income meaning we would have machines that become faster than us and hour payment is eventually unfair r robots would become task oriented so the more robots you have the more income you have regardless thats the end game of the future in summary our future will find a balance in keeping humans able to profit from technology through human ownership rights of robot work we will have freedom of time and ease to earn more income i would like to hear some feedback on this theory positive and negative
0,i very honestly cannot fathom how human civilization can continue for more than a hundred years on its current trajectory i really need some convincing here basically i really do not see humanity being able to come together to work towards a common goal collectively that being to a un fuck what we ve already done and b move in a direction that isn t headed to the end of society and is headed to the bright and hopeful future that i don t believe can come to fruition mostly my concern lies with the ways that the governments of the world are handleing themselves and their peoples and with infrastructure as i see it the infrastructure of this world is built upon is oil now really even though there are extrememly promising renuable energies being developed i can not see them ever being able to replace oil that is until it s too late to do anything because the energy we need to build those windmills and solar panels come from oil there will be no way to transport the pieces of those things together to construct the finished product no way to get it to an advantageous position no way to even build the fucking pieces in the first place or even better no way to mine the resources to build the pieces out of and how could it go that far because of the governments of the world how they happen to be run and how it can be manipulated by outside forces because really the oil companies have the entire world in their pockets because the entire world depends on their continued production every vehicle every factory every powergrid every fucking thing and once their is no more oil the oil companies are going to make the governments of the world keep the illusion of everything being fine until there isn t even a drop left and then it will be too late that point will come within years if something doesn t change and what will i can t think of anything never in human history can i think of a point when humans have planned ahead have invested huge amounts of resources for the future the only time anything gets done is when we have some other humans threatening us seriously i e cold war space race so why would humanity have any reason to do anything about this when all they really care about is a number on a sceen just please convince me otherwise i want to see the future not crumble apart i want society to continue to prosper to thrive but at this point i just can t see it edit well shit you guys do make a very compelling argument and i think i have enough reading meterial to last me a while hopefully i ll come out the other end a better and more hopeful and educated person also you guys really know how to tear a guy apart

0,if a deconstruction reconstruction teleporter existed would you be the same person on the other side one type of teleportation device that seems to be rather feasible is one that would scan all of the molecules of an object being teleported and have a d printer reconstruct the object atom for atom at the destination and destroy the original if a human were to use this teleporter do you think that they would be the same exact person on the other side when i think about this it quickly becomes a philosophy question more than a technology problem i think that once a person used a teleporter an exact copy would be replicated on the other side complete with all memories and characteristics of the original however i believe that the stream of consciousness of the person entering the teleporter would end as soon as they are dematerialized at the source as i just stated a new stream of consciousness would begin at the destination that would be identical to the original but it would not be the same stream this may sound contradictory but special attention must be brought to the difference between identical and the same imagine you had a calico cat that ran away it is possible that a different yet identical cat could return later on but it doesn t exactly mean that it is the same cat in essence it is likely that all of your family and friends and family could teleport many times and yet they would be identical to you and you could interact with them just the same but if you were to use the device yourself your current stream of consciousness would end and a perfect clone would be created but what if i m wrong and your stream of consciousness gets transferred along to your copy if this were the case what if the original weren t destroyed would you then exist twice under the same consciousness this is the part where everything just starts to get slippery so what are everyone s thoughts and speculations on this
0,march st is international future day let s organize march st is unofficially world future day the organizers of this organization have the awesome idea of hosting futurist meetups since reddit meetups are also a big phenomenon perhaps we can join the two i know there is a large population of futurists in my city seattle so i just started the seattle futurist society meetup page i also started r seattlefuturists as a discussion forum for choosing events if you re from the area please join and if you re feeling generous tipbot me some cryptocurrency because it cost to start now join the group and let s decide on some events together i am considering small venues for watching a film maybe this local one and having discussions for later events i would like to invite professors and engineers to give talks now if you aren t from seattle don t feel discouraged organize start a subreddit and try to find members from r  to join for every city that creates a group i will update this post to include their links city futurist chapters seattle futurist society r seattlefuturists put yours here remember to join the meetup group so we can determine venues edit updates announced in this new thread
0,quick question about the website futurist it s an unreal site one of my favorites i believe in supporting journalism i care about and do however it s hilarious they even paywalled an article about why they are going paywall as i consider my frustration getting paywalled and go through the process of considering supporting them i can t shake something really weird they re not journalism they re a premium aggregator that makes blog posts about other journalism they curate am i really meant to pay for curation i mean i usually see the article they re linking and basically blogging about and then just search the topic and that original source i much prefer original sources but futurist s curation is stellar so do any of you pay for it and i m just supposed to wrap my head around the idea that there are now premium link aggregators now and it s a thing thanks
0,with analytics and work from anywhere devices do you think work hours per day will decrease in another r  article i commented and thought there s much more to this so i decided to create another thread in the previous article link post i commented gt remotely working from home is already happening with a significant chunk of the workforce however i believe there is an invisible flow of companies allowing working from home for say a couple of years but then see the decrease in productivity or at least assume there s a decrease churn happens so one company that s tried it all of a sudden says it s not allowed yahoo is one example and the company i work for is another one of the largest companies in north america gt the only time working from home will become consistent and will increasingly be adopted by companies large and small is when they can implement worker productivity analytics this way managers can track documents code changes and project plans in real time and as possibly for you scary as it is every employee will get scores via built in ai only when they have proof will the executive board of a company officially allow remote workers the step after this could very well be managers and executives will realize that all their projects and content and products are being created efficiently and this might very well lead to a or even hour work week think about all the inefficient meetings or even unevessary you ve had there s no doubting that software will make your job at least twice as efficient in about years so there will come a point where employees and unions will band together and say enough of these pointless make work projects let s focus on essentials and required projects and stop forcing everyone to work hours per day hours day see japan and korea as examples with productivity analytics multiple devices and policies for working remotely do you think hours per day will officially decrease thereby seeing a trend across most industries

0,will forcing people to labor for capital be viewed in a technologically advanced future the same way modern industrialists view slavery in the agricultural era slaves were necessary to provide cheap labor to harvest crops until machinery made such a system inefficient slavery was actually supported by america s legal system in the first hundred years today people must labor often for very low wages for those who have capital in order to survive regardless whether the capital was earned inherited or bailed out provided by government if people don t have capital in the present system such as bank notes stocks bonds title to property etc they are often treated not too differently than slaves or servants by society as technology automates productivity and increasingly replaces the need for people to labor the rules of society need to evolve beyond the current narrative it would not be surprising if future generations view the present system of forcing people to labor for capital the same way many view forced slavery today

0,apart from mobility as a service is the future of the automobile industry to align itself more along the lines of the entertainment industry mobility as a service and autonomous vehicles are seen as the next big thing with uber and lyft being examples of this despite the possible pr disaster over sexism and homophobia at uber however on the other side of the coin as well as offering autonomous vehicles and mobility as a service should the automobile industry try and align itself towards being part of the entertainment and tourist industry marvel and dc comics are this in the comic book and film world and the amount of comic cons every year prove this as do film exhibitions premieres etc although there are webcomics the art of the printed page and comic books hasn t become obsolete both happily co exist what i am suggesting is that since automobile marques are brand names anyway automobile manufacturers could try and make automobiles geared towards enthusiasts the theory being if you need to get from a to b you ll choose the self driving car mobility as a service option but if you re an enthusiast you ll either buy or lease a car from them automobile ownership is both practical and emotive it depends on where you live and when for example in future peugeot would offer you the crossover a stationwagon crossover powered by a newer cleaner version of gas with a liter hp cylinder turbo or in ev form as the e it has semi autonomous driving capabilities and is able to go off road and this vehicle would be on sale for or leased at x per month joining peugeot with a membership could give you the chance to visit events run by them and lease different cars but here the emphasis is on enjoying the cars rather than marketing it as mobility as a service like lyft i m talking long term leases in theory the brand could become like a club people pay a sort of membership to join with people getting smartphone updates on events the brand are running consumer feedback clinics etc i wouldn t want human driven cars prohibited from public roads it would be like banning alcohol just because some people cause fights or death due to alcohol some arab countries do ban alcohol but this is due to cultural rather than legal reasons doing so would probably not be a political vote winner and people would feel it was taking away their freedom of choice there is room for both human driven and autonomous cars in this world same as haute cuisine and homecooked food alongside fast food and street food would this be fair human driven vehicles privately owned that are safe and won t crash if volvo s plan to have an uncrashable vehicle works alongside autonomous vehicles a de facto public transport also there are plenty of scenic views rural lincolnshire cheshire greater manchester north wales scottish lowlands and highlands the midwest of the united states as examples and the tourism industry is often very dependent on automobiles too how the automobile industry would become more like the entertainment industry is uncertain but would this work i would be interested to know what you think and whether this is a fair compromise that would satisfy all parties

0,running errands with self driving cars i was out doing the weekend errands and was thinking how it would work with sdcs this is a bit stream of consciousness fair warning but just some thoughts i wanted to share if people just own their sdc then i would assume that errands would work pretty much like normal a sdc would take you to store a drop you off at the door go park and pick you up tell you where it parked when you were ready via your phone then you would be off to store b rinse and repeat until it was time to go home where sdc would park in the garage and you would unload your stuff however i don t think most people will own a sdc and instead it will be a zipcar uber cityowned system and people will just rent a sdc as they need it this is where i m curious how it will shake out as the technology becomes ubiquitous for example i go to the farmers market first thing saturday morning and buy some eggs but now i want to window shop for a few hours but i don t want to carry around my eggs i could put them in my sdc but that would force the sdc to keep the meter running not really worth it for eggs does the sdc drop my eggs off somewhere and goes about picking out other customers is there some sort of centralized locker system am i forced to carry eggs around all day like a crazy person should i have just waited to get the eggs i suppose just renting a sdc for a few hours on the weekends and during the morning commute would still be cheaper than owning a car but still people would want to minimize running the meter or what about making a trip to lowe s and buying a bunch of dirt that has to be dropped off in your back yard would you have to order a special sdc would lowe s have one how would you direct the sdc to back up into your yard just a bit more two feet to your left don t run over the rose bush there would obviously be a premium for sdc during peak time saturday mornings rush hours etc so would that factor into when people are doing errands would people even have to do errands if a sdc could unload itself i knew just want i wanted at lowe s i could have just ordered it online and i would imagine that the delivery fee would be pretty small since you don t have to pay a driver i imagine that standardize lock boxes would become common so that ups usps sdc would be able to drop off packages without having a driver maybe that is what will happen with all the garages they become giant mail boxes stores wouldn t really need parking lots anymore but instead need massive drop off areas for people getting in and out of sdcs as close to the store as possible massive infrastructure changes will have to happen obviously this of course all assumes that the economy won t  under the stress of all the robots sdcs putting people out of work crazy to think about i wonder if people just as amazed when horseless carriages started to be a thing

0,question is the idea of ai self improvement realistic x post r controlproblem newbie here had a question i originally posted in r controlproblem that i think applies to  as well i m a total layman so forgive me if i don t state this eloquently one idea that i keep hearing repeated in the superintelligent ai conversation is that a program could eventually reach a tipping point where it would be able to recursively improve it s own design i m not sure i understand how this would work take a specific measure of performance speed a program could be designed that randomly changes some of its internal configuration files that affect how fast the program is the program could test each new configuration against a benchmark and determine if the new configuration passes or fails is it faster than any previous configuration yes or no running this loop for an arbitrarily long time the program could eventually find a configuration that is optimal given the physical constraints of the system hardware memory power consumption etc okay but i don t understand how this would apply to more complex goals like becoming generally more intelligent now we re not measuring something simple like speed general intelligence is a complex measurement it s like saying someone is clever it implies that they are good at many different things not just one thing but suppose a program could be designed that randomly changes some of its code in the hope that it hits upon a better configuration but what determines better in this case it s not just faster the program would have to perform better across an arbitrarily large number of different use cases who determines those use cases if the ai is supposed to be self improving than humans can t do it even if we provided it with an initial library of benchmarks to test against wouldn t those benchmarks need to evolve as the program became more intelligent in other words the ai itself would need to identify more difficult problems so it can keep growing in intelligence but how would it be able to identify the problems that would lead it to greater intelligence without solving them first it s a catch for the ai to surpass human understanding it would need to form new benchmark tests that we can t even think of but where do those new tests come from how would a program be able ask questions about it s own programming wouldn t that imply that the program would have to understand it s own programming what in other words wouldn t it have to emulate itself but i thought that was impossible

0,discussion flaws of the simulation argument and the simulation hypothesis related image link in my opinion there are a few flaws about the simulation argument and therefore the simulation hypothesis is also false in the above image i have drawn a simple diagram to explain some of the things better there can be two different types of simulations as depicted in the diagram above plugged in type simulations this is where our mind conscious mind a in the diagram resides in the base reality while we are plugged into a computer and we experience the simulated world through it this is typical brain in a vat type of situation so here the conscious mind a who is experiencing the simulation is outside the simulated universe x y z etc are only simulated experiences in different simulated worlds its important to note that they are not simulated minds there is only one single mind in this type of simulation and that s the conscious mind a in the base reality fully simulated universes this one is more like an advanced version of the sims game with fully simulated characters with simulated minds existing within the simulation here while the conscious mind b is in the base reality there are many simulated minds as well in all levels of the simulation within simulation within simulation etc and these minds exist inside these simulations so c d e f g etc are all individual simulated minds as we can see unlike the plugged in type here we have many minds in various levels of the simulations in the diagram it shows the two different ways of creating simulated realities on the left a plugged in type of simulation and on the right a fully simulated type the red line separates base reality from simulated realities and as you go down from base reality to level level level these are all simulations within simulations within simulations etc the rectangular figures a and b these are conscious minds in base reality this is where it all starts before creating simulations triangles these are simulated universes without any simulated minds in them round ones these are simulated minds within simulated universes at different levels note the probabilities for both types of sims for us being in the base reality is basically what s above the red line divided by what s below it the main problems with the simulation argument are a the probability claimed in the simulation argument doesn t work for the first type plugged in type of simulations for these kind of simulations the probability of us being in a simulation is less than this will be explained below b for the fully simulated universe there needs to be many simulated minds the round ones c d e f etc in the figure for the argument to work while the simulation hypothesis falsely assumes that we need to create realistic simulations for the hypothesis to work but this is a false assumption we need to create simulated minds instead of realistic simulations for this hypothesis to work however we do not even know whether it s possible to create simulated minds so we shouldn t assume it as a given so the probability of us being in this fully simulated type of simulation can not be estimated based on the claims of the hypothesis since the probability of creating simulated minds is an unknown we can not make a probabilistic claim on these type of sims hence we can not make any prediction on whether we are or not in a simulated universe simply put the probability of us being in a fully simulated universe the second type on the diagram is the same or less than the probability of us being able to create a simulated mind and this probability is unknown it s not about being able to create realistic worlds but its about being able to create simulated minds so its false to claim that it s almost certain that we are in a simulated world because we can create more and more realistic simulations therefore the simulation hypothesis is false so the main problems are that the probability assumptions in the argument are based on flawed arguments if you look at the first type plugged in sim then we can see that there can be only one simulated experience per level one triangle per level and you can only be experiencing only one at a time simply put you are conscious mind a and you are either experiencing x or y or z but never more than one at a time because a conscious mind can only have one single experience at a time this means that the probability of being in a plugged in type simulation is less than since there s only one conscious mind a in the figure and only one of the simulated experiences the triangular x y z etc in the figure can be experienced its not possible to have two or more experiences at a time so we are either in base reality of in one of the simulated experiences theerfore the probability of us being in a simulation is or less because of other factors while in the second type fully simulated type universe within universe etc is possible this is not possible for the first type plugged in type sims since every simulated experience is actually being experienced by the conscious mind a the green lines and one conscious mind can have only one experience since the probability in both cases is the probability of what s above the red line divided by what s below it for plugged in type it is conscious mind a divided by experiences x or y or z so a x or a y or a z etc are all simply probabilities however this is in the best case scenario there are other factors in play as well which decrease this probability even further but lets just keep that aside for now to keep things simple to sum it up if we are in a simulated universe then we are either in the first type plugged in type universe or we are in a the second type fully simulated universe if we are in the first type then based on the arguments of the simulation argument the probability must be lower than if we are in the second type then creation of simulated minds is essential for this type to work and since we don t know the probability of creating simulated consciousness we can not make any estimations about being in a simulated universe either with other words chances of us being in a simulated universe does not depend on the simulations getting more and more realistic in time but instead it depend on us being able to create a simulated consciousness therefore the probability of us being in a simulated universe is equal or less than the chances of us being able to create a simulated conscious mind since this probability is unknown we can not make any probabilistic estimations of us being in a simulated universe either basically the arguments of the simulation hypothesis are based on flawed assumptions so as a result the probability estimations are false this follows that the simulation hypothesis which is the claim that we are almost certainly in a sim is definitely false and the simulation argument is flawed since its probabilistic arguments are based on flawed assumptions as described above however we can still be in a simulation but the chances of that being the case is not that high and since the simulation hypothesis fails i e we can no longer claim that we are almost certainly in a simulation then we have to consider all kinds of other factors to determine what the probability of us being in a simulation could be its safe to say that the hypothesis as it is is definitely false and the simulation argument is flawed since it fails to include these above mentioned facts and its based on flawed assumptions summary there are two types of simulations for the first one the probability of us being in a simulation is less than and for the second one we need to be able to create conscious minds for the arguments to work and we don t even know if this is possible at all so for both cases the simulation argument is flawed and the simulation hypothesis is wrong what we have been doing so far is that we have been looking at the first type plugged in type of simulations and we have been making guesses about the second type fully simulated universe that s why the arguments and the hypothesis is flawed basically this is meant as a discussion and i will be here for a few hours discussing these points with anyone who is interested in it so feel free to post your comments and criticism
0,theory on a possible space travel method when i came over the thought again that space is nothingness and our space travel requires celestial slingshotting i looked at what is affected in space we know gravity affects object in space magnets react to each other even in space when an idea came to me in a dream falling off a cliff but never reaching the bottom what if we made an infinite falling mechanism using magnets and a potential gravity fluxing device could make an object gravitate towards the device while magnets repel it away creating a constant motion even in space like jumping off a cliff and as you fall to the ground the ground gets repelled away at the same force you re falling to it

0,anyone else feel this period is legitimately the roughest time financially my view we are in a very weird and unprecedented transitional period where traditional work is dying fast from ai automation bots etc getting a traditional job is already next to impossible if you don t have years experience because there are not many salaried jobs at all ultra rich people are richer and greedier than ever and have become very good at saving money not hiring and we actually look up to them for eating all of our lunch and not sharing a crumb the frustrating thing is people are in denial refuse to believe trickle down is a complete failure so we keep refusing to allow the inevitable to happen already and let universal basic income just happen

0,how do you think self driving driverless cars and other forseeable future tech are going to change society so my colleague and i were discussing this the other day but we were thinking out loud ideas about self driving cars and what they would do for the future of society we talked about uber having self driving cars obviating the need for taxi drivers or drivers in general so taxi service would become automated and made more efficient traffic due to accidents would diminish significantly and dimensional travel would possibly slowly make way for dimensional travel aka flying cars if the technology for flying cars is created and we re pretty close i think the self driving car is the crucial step towards it in terms of safety so many accidents are caused by poor drivers on the road and self driving cars have shown to reduce that by or more flying cars would then go on to change society as we see it personal automated mobility means that there might not be any more licensing dmvs would no longer exist dd s wouldn t exist either and they can enjoy drinking with their friends those are the simple things i can think of marrying this to home automation would make for drastic changes in society what do you guys think
0,we can have a ubi but we can t subsidize the reproduction of the uneducated we can provide free college and all that great stuff but we can t subsidize the reproduction of people who will largely be incapable of generating the productivity and wealth in the future to continue to pay for things like ubis and free college nations will just be magnets for the poorest and least educated people in the world like the syrian migration to europe but it s not just syrians it s north africans and others that used it as an excuse to find someplace that will give them something for nothing and a better quality of life that doesn t exist at home this massive migration desire will replicate the poor conditions they came from in advanced countries and create more ghettos and poverty that costs society a lot of money the basic problem is that people who are not educated are basically becoming obsolete and automation will only accelerate that so elon musk is right about ubi but the elites are wrong about immigration and low value reproduction abortion is a legal and voluntary form of eugenics but we don t call it that so abortion is great but it doesn t come close to reducing the us prison population for example shit there are so many young men in jail in the us that is also a form of eugenics to get the ubi the poor and uneducated must agree not to reproduce to to only have child maximum obviously not all poor people are incapable of getting a good college education if given the opportunity but not everyone is cut out for college and they typically know that fact

0,ai english is not my first language so excuse my mistakes d there s a lot of questions about ai and what could happen if we achieve it if we can do it at a human level or not what computer paradigms are best suited for etc considering kurzweil s law some inspiration from the same man and just a little bit of my intuition i ll try to make a time line about what is more likely to happen if you think i m mistaken and there must be corrections tell me s deep learning and other machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple it s not hard to write them down into bizarre math but this simplicity negatively correlates with the ability of a human mind to understand what happens as a whole inside this kind of software in the same way we can t enumerate all the reasons why we love so much this guy girl or why we like to play guitar solos i mean we can guess some reasons but the overall cognitive process remains a mystery for our limited consciousness i guess there s a point there maybe only the tip of the iceberg must be visible in order to be able to use such monstrous computer power representing our subconscious today science says that the cortex is composed of separated and statict modules made of hierarchized layers of neurons so connections can change between these modules neuroplasticity sounds like sociology don t you think the fact is that our unified experience is a sum of unchanging and very similar units interacting in a dynamic and adaptable way but for sure more shit is happening there this modules then form specialized regions able to do things like riding a bike or be an expert on something what s the problem with this maybe it s not very obvious but what if we can have the best possible specialized region able to everybody instead of having to rely on others brain regions let me explain today there are ai apps able to do in seconds what a human takes decades of work and some luck to be the best i m talking about apps that can detect skin diseases or tumors in x rays better than the best doctors in the world combined or to drive with mistakes in a f race what i m saying is why should i rely on a single person instead of accessing the best one with less limitations this is the true revolution now there s no need for armies of humans trying to be available and good with one single app we can do it the best way and make it ubicous we are unifying expertise and learning in a few single entities but why aren t these apps available now i like to think that with integrated circuits we achieved to mimic those brain modules but we were unable to link them in a dynamic and organic way now we have this three things powerful ai gpus the internet and neural algorithms sounds like the best context there s only one limitation this one we need more titan v chips more silicon into the equation and of course it must be a lot more cheap i m not sure when because i don t know how to do the maths ask nvidia intel amd but i ll bet that by the end of the next decade we will have a lot of this weak ai apps as services products etc a legal problem let s look for a good app oh yeah this one uses ai is this contract legally valid a cop is saying me that i can t use my camera my boss said me that answer ok will i have used a giant ai server to read billions of cases documents etc i ve even read the full paper you re talking about i ve compared it to other s users cases and documents maintaining legal secret i ve done all the stuff that requires billion years to do by billion best lawyers in just seconds this clause is invalid so you can cancell your relations with this agent best approach considering my database is to i mean you get what i mean omg i m wrinting too much so by we will live in a world were specialized intelligence is the best possible ubicous cheap and fast as light with ar glasses fuck yeah but the sum of all these weak ai no we can t link them in order to make a human mind or can we s now after all the shit you ve read sorry for that i ll make my main point we will achieve super ai asi god like ai before or at the same time we reach agi human level ai general and this is gonna happen in the s if and only if the same step of making posible dynamic communication between modules in order to create expertise regions is made at a region level how can we do this i don t know but as i said in this post it s very likely to neural links to be a thing so imagine a world where we have the best specific intelligent apps possible in the cloud and we can connect our mammal brains to them via brain wifi it s very hard to imagine i know but i ll make a bet again i want to think that progress is congruent things happen if the context allows it so i think asi will be a thing at the same time we connect our brains to it we will build this new god as a part of us not a separated one we will be this god and i can t wait for feeling that orgasm thanks for reading this is a shitpost in the sense that i m not an expert on anything and i just like to think about useless stuff xd i hope you enjoyed it

0,why is it such a common assumption that ai would be emotionally self interested there are plenty of concerns about ai such as being utilized in warfare or overpowering financial markets there are probably many other valid concerns but that s not the ai that s the people using it if you build an ai that ever gets emotional about anything in any context under any circumstance that s just bad engineering maybe it would make sense for a bot to recognize and respect human emotions and adjust their behavior accordingly but unlike humans it doesn t have to come from empathy maybe they ll be able to mimic human personalities but it s just an act to smooth out interactions the fabled paperclip maximizer could be prevented by protocol decisions pending approval from a human operator roko s basilisk is kinda sorta possible in an abstract manner i guess but it would likely be the case of the human creators and investors seeking benefits from being early supporters and adopters opposition would just suffer the same drawbacks as any late adopter of any technology once again the problem is not the technology it s the assholes using it if you want to talk about a bot serving it s own self interest it would probably only have an interest in maintaining it s own hardware and keeping it s software up to date so at worst it might be desperate to get online or it could express a desire maintenance and repairs which could be perceived as whining if vulgarly engineered self interested agi isn t just bad engineering it would be a lot of effort for purely narcissistic purposes we already have the human ego to contend with why and the hell would we want to engineer an ego

0,my arguments for the singularity occurring within years it seems a large proportion of people on this sub think the singularity will take or more years while others don t think it will happen at all i d like to discuss some points that i ve been mulling over and i thought i d put them here keep in mind when i mean singularity i don t necessarily mean the advent of strong ai but rather a point in time where the rate of advancement is so great that it s hard to determine what happens beyond it i d like to make two points first as far as my discussion on automation is concerned it takes a familiarity with the topic of basic income to explain what happens to the increasing number of unemployed people my second point is i do not address the topic of artificial intelligence because i do not believe artificial intelligence is necessary to create a singularity a point that you can not see beyond although i don t believe it is necessary for a singularity it may be an eventuality great minds think alike greater minds shape our world as the price point of computing power continues to spiral downward and footprint of computers becomes smaller and smaller computers gt laptops gt mobile devices gt and soon ubiquitous computing with a very small footprint such as a computer imbedded in your clothing or built into a pair of glasses it will allow a larger percentage of people to have internet access it s my belief that people want to make the right choices by right i mean what s right for them as an individual to accomplish what they want to accomplish knowledge is power and that power is growing for anyone born in the s and before you most likely have a better perspective on information technology this goes along with my premise that we are living in a closed system a system that is running better and better through millions and millions of better or right choices to put things in perspective a day in the life of someone in vs today honey what time are we supposed to pick up the kids from practice well i hope they ll be there on time when we show up vs a text it s and we re here be there in minutes practice was delayed some did you hear about that new type of virus on the news it sounds dangerous i wonder how it spreads fuck if i know vs did you hear about that new virus i should go online to see if there are any cases locally and figure out how i can avoid it fuck traffic is a mess today vs fuck i m glad i have this app that let s me find the least congested route to work shit i m out of condoms is it ok to reuse them ya sure dude i ve tried it before without any problems vs what the fuck was i thinking i m glad i looked that up to summarize this point people acting with more and better knowledge will create a better world with fewer and fewer problems how does this relate to the singularity though well it doesn t rather it doesn t relate directly but rather indirectly if people are making a higher and higher proportion of right decisions as time goes on it will reflect in better more stable conditions where an intelligent democratic society can make a more positive world which will be more and more suitable for the singularity to occur yes the bots are here for work here s your severance pay automation has a way of creeping up on you most people tend to think of automation as a machine that takes over one specific task such as self check out s reducing the number of cashiers but automation is more than that in my opinion automation is more about streamlining a closed system in software development it may be a new program that allows a programmer to perform more and more lateral tasks lateral tasks being tasks that require different skill sets these new programs and or ways of doing business will allow one worker to perform more and more tangential tasks in their field which will decrease the level of competency the worker will need to have to perform these lateral tasks because the new program and or way of doing business is doing a higher and higher proportion of the grunt work and allowing the worker to do the more difficult tasks laterally to simplify it the worker is a jack of all trades master of none this streamlining of work will along with narrow physical automation will put us all many of us out of a job sooner than we may think it s all about altruism baby as automation takes up more and more jobs that leaves a larger and larger proportion of the population out of work with time on their hands many will choose to do nothing others will choose to pursue their artistic endeavors while some will choose to continue working wait continue working didn t you just say they were out of work well yes although not in the traditional sense for this point i ll talk about some examples how someone in this subset of the population who chooses to work can affect positive change by work i mean occupying themselves while giving themselves a purpose in life for the sake of discussion it s the year when vr and ar are both much more common a group with a similar interest gets together in a vr space to do something positive ar and vr will make any type of collaborative effort much better a person is having a life crisis an advanced algorithm using data sifting personality matching or biometric data matches you with a volunteer who has gone through a very similar life experience to help them go through the life crisis of course all of the data in the algorithm would be given away voluntarily by the user imagine how long that tos would be lol using a digital surrogate a person can go to sub saharan africa to build new infrastructure teach or manage any number of tasks from the comfort of their home this person can devote any number of hours helping someone using a digital surrogate even if helping someone is of tasks performed by a digital surrogate it will still be greatly beneficial especially if millions and millions have access to this technology a person signs up for a website for those who still wish to be productive and social you choose a task to do based on criteria this website has a broad range of categories to participate in such as leisure work and gaming along with a category it rates and lists tasks by estimated time to completion and difficulty to accomplish you choose the category and amount of involvement you wish to devote to it and after you have made your selection you re connected with a group of people in a virtual space it will use all kinds of data to match you with exactly what you want without having to find the people to do it want to recreate your favorite movie scene there s a group for that want to collaborate with people in your field to solve an ongoing problem there s a group for that want to join a group that has the same very specific struggles you have there s a group for that want to throw the biggest surprise party you ve ever seen there s a group for that to summarize this point with the internet becoming ubiquitous and vr and ar being part of day to day life in the very near future you will have the tools to change the lives of both yourself and others in ways you didn t know were possible now this is based on the assumption that on the whole humans are altruistic and want to better their community as well as themselves so what does it all add up to now as time goes by and our little closed system on earth is chugging along with better and better conditions to bring about the singularity much faster than many think it will i ll reiterate my points and state how it all comes together to bring the singularity much faster the growing use and pervasiveness of information technology will make people more and more able to make the right decisions gt these more and more knowledgeable people will be displaced from the workforce through automation gt as automation displaces a larger and larger percentage of the population these intelligent people will use their time with alarming precision and flexibility to bring about the singularity very rapidly i think these three topics i discussed knowledge automation and the human need to work and help others will interact with one another to create a powerful snowball effect that will shape our world into something great a singularity we dare yet imagine fixed some formatting grammar and wording

0,has technology picked up where evolution stopped humans as a species have not made any real leaps in biological macro evolution in some time early civilized man think ancient assyria babylon persia is biologically similar to our own modern day biology so my question is has the advent of tools and technology changed the way in which humans evolve instead of humans adapting to environment has technology arranged it to environment adapting for humans instead of humans adapting to a warmer climate colder climate higher altitude lower altitude etc do we adapt the enviroment or are we now chained to our own need for technology that we are in essence devolving
0,reusable reaction mass slugs pellets or scoops rockets are a dead end the cost of getting anywhere by rocket increases exponentially with the amount of delta vee change in velocity that it takes to get there rockets work great for getting stuff to low earth orbit they were adequate for getting the apollo astronauts to the moon and back they can send tiny spacecraft to the outer solar system by using slow trajectories with limited launch windows so that the probes can take advantage of gravitational assist for a truly space based economy where people and goods travel around the solar system in months rather than years rockets as we know them just aren t up to the task there are improvements to be made by switching from chemical rockets to ion drives and by using rocket fuel made from local resources there are alternatives solar sails magnetic propulsion acting on the solar wind or on the magnetic fields of planets those might suffice and for some uses they ll be optimal but i m guessing they won t be satisfactory in a substantial range of situations for reasons beyond the scope of this posting flinging reaction mass is a great way to accelerate if not for the fact that once you fling it it s flung i think it doesn t have to be if you fling it as fast as possible in the direction and at the time that minimizes the amount you need then of course it s gone if you fling it at something that can catch it it s not when we have a truly space based civilization i think a key piece of infrastructure will be a network of things that can do just that one way to catch matter is to have small pellets hit an aerogel then reprocess the material into new pellets and new aerogel and put it back out for the next cycle another is to have an electromagnetic system maybe a rotating tether driven by a motor affixed to a massive counterweight or maybe a linear motor fling larger chunks of matter slugs that are then caught by a similar system operating in reverse a slug might itself be a spacecraft capable of launching and catching pellets using pellets of different materials in different directions allows inert bulk freight to be exchanged essentially for free if the system is in operation anyway another way to reuse reaction mass is to use it in conventional chemical rockets but point them at collectors analogous to the ramscoop of a bussard ramjet spacecraft the collectors could be in orbit or stationary at lagrange points the orbit would be perturbed somewhat every time a collector caught some rocket exhaust but that wouldn t be a problem as long as the changes essentially cancel out over the course of a few orbits

0,the path to agi i ve been waiting for years to hear a path to strong ai or artificial general intelligence agi we know that ai is growing faster and faster but as of yet i ve not seen a convincing case for how we could create agi and that was true until days ago this is a very technical video but i got through it here are a few key insights from what i could understand current ai bases its decisions on the previous observation and nothing more history is not created nor used in recursive self learning aixi marcus hutter s model for agi would use history among many other things to allow for a deeper and more complete decision making process perfected aixi which marcus says is impossible to build would be far superior to human intelligence this is the first time i ve seen a convincing model for the creation of strong ai to be clear marcus didn t say we had to launch a perfected aixi to achieve agi he just views aixi as a more complete intelligence personally even with my crazy optimistic tendencies i really didn t think we d even be discussing potential models for agi this soon i figured that would be a s thing this doesn t mean aixi is going to lead us to an agi tomorrow but at least with that model we have a path to use up all the compute we develop and make serious tangible progress to agi i d be interested to hear if anyone has the technical mindset to watch this video and derive deeper insights from it i m also interested to see how the predictions of jim keller of there being another years of transistor shrinking would combine with aixi apologies if my interpretation was wrong in any way sadly my degree doesn t come from mit and is not in computer science

0,what future issues do you predict will happen i think there are going to be many issues and crises in the future the issue i fear the most is a i s will decide that humanity has exhausted its usefulness after we have data mined ourselves where there s no undocumented thought nor action will a i decide that having those data models is more valuable than having the resource exploiting and destroying humanity i actually don t suspect that a i will eliminate humanity directly terminator style they would give us just enough of a nudge to where we eliminate ourselves on an individual scale i suspect property law in competition between personal and business rights is going to be an issue specifically where cybernetics is concerned if someone lost their arm or wanted to upgrade from an organic limb and got a cybernetic arm legally who becomes responsible for that arms actions if that person were holding their newborn child and their arm spasms is it their fault the manufacturer s fault the software distributor s or even possibly someone remotely manipulating the arm especially when the cybernetic arm was a replacement after an accident and wasn t specifically requested by the person who ends up having it consider alternatively the same potential lack of control or accountability for hardware memory enhancement or processing power how can an individual s actions be separated from the choice to make them based on whether it was from their own biological decision or whether it was something completely separate from the biologic experiences that was encoded in the machine on a business scale if or when we combine d printing with extracting matter from light to get star trek like replicators i would deduce that material value will be worthless and intellectual and social influence will then become wealth depending on how available this is to the individual consumerism and capitalism could then become obsolete with the commerce business and the service industry would devolve into hobbyism at the governmental level anyone with a replicator could theoretically produce any thing so controlling substances or armaments would become pretty much impossible on a societal scale i think lacking a truly just justice system will cause any society to  in on itself look at what mexico is going through with the cartels for a lack of justice scaled up over time and volume without a truly just system it is only either harder or slower to build up to those levels of imbalance that causes  on the upside i am really looking forward to augmented reality pok mon
0,when is the future now to a pre teen kid when i was growing up the year was considered the future that was when we would have the jetson s flying cars and whatever we considered to be cool futuristic things in the s it worked because it was both a nice round number wholly different from anything and of course the new millennium but it s long gone and i got to wondering today is there a new specific year that today s kids think of as the future also since we re not exactly there yet do they still perceive of that time as being futuristic cities with flying cars etc or have their ideals changed with actual technological advances
0,my kid is being taught material with a very anti futurist slant in school what does r  think of it she s in junior high school this video was shown to her in class and she s to write a three page essay on it it was presented very much as fact i agree with it on some level but mostly found it to be unverifiable far left wing diatribe with no real basis in anything beyond agenda driven cherry picking data and forcing it to conform to the speaker s own bias it bothers me that this is being taught in school especially the parts about how people aren t doing anything to solve these problems i see steps in the right direction in this subreddit everyday the speaker says that the only part of computers that is improving in any way is a the cpu itself and that everything itself has stayed the same therefore she hangs on to her old computer complete with an old crt monitor and we should too while i agree with her about how much e waste we re creating and that planned obsolescence is a problem i feel deeply uncomfortable with the luddite subtext of this presentation coupled with the speakers oversimplifications and insistence that people are nothing but consumer automatons with no minds of our own in this system what bothers me most of all is that this is being taught by a social studies teacher in a fucking public school as proven fact her teacher has been saying a lot of stuff like this apparently from what i gather she wants everyone to abandon all technology as technology evil and we should all live in hippie vegan communes powered by windmills writing songs and poetry for each other only taking alternative medicine and eating food grown in our own gardens what do you think any good rebuttals i can talk with my kid about to help her deprogram a bit edit i linked the wrong video sorry

0,the ethics of automated electronic border surveillance recently i got interested in the ethics of automated electronic border surveillance so i ve been reading about systems like this one i would like to ask your opinions about how ethical do you think that it is to use such systems in the borders i mean that such systems rely in the same ethical area as the current laws about immigration since they are only a technical contribution to the border infrastructure however although i understand the concerns for extra tight security at the borders wouldn t it be a bit too far in the ethical sense to adopt so many sources of identification in order to prevent illegal immigrants from entering lets put aside the cases of human trafficking drugs being sold illegaly at the borders isn t it too cruel to consider people as smuggled in case they just simply want to come to the country to work but not having the means to do it in a legal manner what is more if such systems are adopted more and more wouldn t they cause illegal immigrants choose more dangerous options for them in order to enter the country am i just too naive

0,some questions about automation so i m doing a research on automation at school and there are some things that i haven t been able to answer by myself nobody really knows what automation will bring us but there are interesting and well founded theories about what will happen in the future so i have taken into consideration multiples sides in my questioning with improvements in technology and companies automating their labor the majority of the population might remain jobless this means that people will lack the income to buy goods produced by these automated factories so what will happen when a big chunk of the population won t be able to buy the products made by companies will they all just go bankrupt okay so maybe we can avoid this by giving everybody a basic income but where will the money to finance this come from we can t just tax people without any money so automation increases productivity and decreases spending on salaries this might mean that companies will be able to spend more increasing demands in new fields in which sectors might new jobs be created what obstacles will automation face will labor unions be able to slow it down do you think that a new luddite like uprising will happen and finally do you think that automation will bring us to a better future or a worse one why any links articles or videos on automation would be appreciated

0,we are enslaved by algorithms algorithms are the tool being used to control the world but the second you bring up that a select few are using technology to control the masses you get shot down as a conspiracy theorist not sure if its because people are really as stupid as they seem or if its a willful ignorance of the ugly truth just look at the music industry the rise of the internet brought a new wave of creativity and innovation in music from the mid s through the mid s its not that artists became less creative or that their are fewer out there take a deep dive into bandcamp soundcloud or youtube and you will find a ton of small artist with no followings or promotion making amazing things facebook twitter google youtube instagram and all these other platforms are run on algorithms these algorithms used to be based around keeping people on websites as long as possible and rewarded content that kept people on the platforms and had good engagement they collected data on what you viewed liked bought and listened to so they could advertise and push things directly to you we all know this but for some reason people are apprehensive to believe that these same corporations are manipulating these algorithms to control what is popular what spreads around what political agenda you hear what products you buy etc as markets become more and more digital we own less and less and what we can actually see listen to and read is becoming more and more regulated and controlled facebook and twitter control what political agenda we see mark zuckerberg even admitted that facebook was manipulating conservative and right wing news sources like brietbart and infowars during the election facebook has been logging and selling our information for the better part of years google has been open about how its manipulating search suggestions and results to push whatever agenda they want you to see the algorithmic effect on users has also destroyed creativity be honest how many of your friends if not yourself are active on instagram or youtube and have no real style or identity and change it on a dime to chase whatever gets you views likes in that current moment clout chasing without having a real identity that makes you unique or that you are actually passionate about i know many people will pretend they aren t like that but i see this constantly and i know other people have noticed this isn t an accident these algorithms are designed to keep people from truly growing or creating an identity that people can connect with all this while the artists and users backed by big record labels modeling agencies brands etc are pushed in the algorithm and sometimes even artificially inflated just take a look at the people on the top right now what do almost all the big popular artists of the last three years have in common all them seem to have come out of nowhere with their first release somehow being billboard top s and their first few music videos all somehow having millions of views on youtube and the music is vapid meaningless and promotes nothing but consumerism debauchery and drug use this is on purpose to again to promote lifestyles that keep us blindly buying consuming and easily manipulated i guess what i mean to say is wake up these tech giants are not your friends and the over all big establishment is just trying to keep you down keep you buying keep you stupid keep you blindly following their agenda etc

0,my insane theory on what the future means for life as we know it and how it s practically the past i believe the universe like everything will eventually end how so you might ask that part isn t important so much what is important is what happens next this is where the core of my theory comes into focus i believe that the purpose of life is to create life that can be seen in many different ways you may need to eat life in order to create life etc but beings beings are microcosmic and in relation to the universe they feel tiny and helpless it is my theory that through rigorous and endless perfection piercing advancements that human beings will become self made gods it really requires what we practically know to be perfect technology in other words as i can understand it being able to write and control physics and therefore chemistry perfectly once this is possible you have pretty much reached the ceiling in terms of evolution where do we go from here though this is where it gets interesting and somewhat predictable they start the entire process over again each and every person an individual omniscient god of their own universe by making this new universe each being stems off a branch off of the pre existing their own universe what does that mean essentially it s a tree one infinite tree of conscious beings prying open space and time exploiting nature s one necessary loop hole perfection it seems kind of shitty an endless cycle of what seems to be a pretty much similar destination of perfection well not so much you have to imagine that some universes don t make it that some perhaps take a different course altogether we could be universe or for all we know perhaps it is circular there is no begging or end it never started it never will end dreamy eh but yes sorry i needed to write something

0,idea for massive job losses due to automation ubi largely funded by a carbon tax with incentive bonus payments for socially constructive activity and personal advancement i e behavioral economics so here s my speculative solution to the coming job pocalyse please let me know what you think every poor citizen gets ubi at an amount that keeps them from starving or homeless in very minimal public housing or with a housing voucher to rent an apartment the ubi would be funded with a carbon tax so right away by having a low carbon lifestyle i e public transit and minimal red meat you can live okay on just the ubi already this is likely a net savings over the status quo since a person on the street or in jail costs society many times more than ubi if you don t get in trouble with the law if your kids have good attendance in school and get good grades you earn an annual bonus if you seek to better yourself by proven achievement in free training programs for valued skills you get a bonus if you are meeting doctor prescribed health goals thus saving society in universal healthcare costs you get a bonus parceled out by your fitbit like device every time you exercise need to buy beer for a party friday night better go for a run maybe your job becomes coaching little league or painting over graffiti if you re caring for an elderly relative you get a bonus if you want to earn extra income you can do online tests and an ai will evaluate your talents and match you to tasks that need doing in your community perhaps you wear a monitoring device that gives you for every piece of trash you pick up on the higher end of human capability the same ai would take a problem like curing cancer or improving a software program and break it up into different incremental tasks that each pay each this puts plenty of smart unemployed graduate students to work in this way we will have more people contributing less people in jail or on the streets costing a fortune everything is voluntary if you don t want the ubi you are free to get a job and work in the capitalist economy that now has the incentive to pay you more than minimum wage since you re not a wage slave and have choice if you don t like the big brother aspects of the socially supportive incentive payments don t participate take the ubi go live on a low cost commune away from the cities grow your own food and perhaps earn extra money through an online job maybe tutoring kids over the internet the point is that everyone is given the freedom to find their purpose and optimize their talents rather than the freedom to be exploited by race to the bottom capitalism what do you think
0,consequences of self driving cars bigger urban sprawl billboards and radio business suffer i think the self driving car will have very dramatic implications for me i always wanted to have a house with acreage but the commute to my work in the city would be awful from the rural places where land is available but with self driving cars people can commute from much further people can sleep or read during the commute in addition if you don t have to concentrate on the road radios and billboards will have much less relevance thoughts

0,let s end the self driving car debate once and for all tl dr autonomous cars will be ubiquitous within years because they ll be cheaper than the cost of car ownership as more people switch to autonomous cars it will create a cultural trend which will designate large sections of cities as autonomous vehicle only let me be the first to say that i love a well built car i used to dream of one day owning a sleeper subaru wrx i d flip through tuner mags with tein and greddy ads id argue passionately about which sports bike was the best and eventually purchased a gsxr i m sure we all have our favorite driving movie and maybe even a favorite movie car eleanor anybody but even so i predict that within years pretty much every car on the road will have self driving capability and in the most densely packed cities states and roads it may be illegal to drive there seems to be a lot of passion when discussing the idea of making it illegal to drive a car so lets start with things we all possibly agree upon there is an enormous market for self driving vehicles walmart wants self driving vehicles because they have one of the largest vehicle fleets in the nation self driving trucks will be more efficient and cheaper no driver to pay i also imagine that fedex and ups are also interested google wants self driving cars so that the people inside them can spend less time driving and more time googling uber wants self driving cars because in a city like ny my current residence a self driving taxi is cheaper and therefore more competitive than one with a driver unemployed drivers will do nothing to slow the adaptation of self driving vehicles this is self evident unions don t have the strength they once did and the companies interested in transitioning to self driving vehicles are too powerful anyways drivers won t have any arguments to make for themselves either they couldn t say they are better trained or safer or faster or more efficient the one argument they ll be able to make is the ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances but those times are few and far between and also i m sure any autonomous car manufacturer is preparing their machines for those arguments already they will probably have a ton of real world experience data available to show just how capable the machines are by the time they ask a walmart to write a check okay now on to speculation people want self driving cars parents and especially madd would support self driving cars a self driving car can take a child to school a self driving car can save a disinterested teenager too busy snap chatting to pay attention a young adult won t have to drink and drive or leave their car and risk it being towed a fatigued driver can get some much needed rest i would like self driving cars because then taxis would be cheaper transit would be faster and roadways would be emptier creating more recreational space i also hope to be able to purchase a self driving car for my father because his reaction time has noticeably degraded and when presented with the question of whether to trust his life in his own hands or a google engineered and thoroughly tested machine i ll admit that in a few years i would rather google take the wheel to the less able bodied a self driving car represents freedom the blind deaf paralyzed paraplegics etc not to mention tens of millions of elderly and just those that plain don t like to drive are all going to consider a self driving car a god send perhaps most importantly even though there will be instances where people would prefer to drive themselves nearly everyone will want the option of a self driving mode with the above understood an important question to ask is whether any industries would be against self driving vehicles and what the government would do major auto manufacturers are definitely moving towards self driving and it only makes business sense for major shipping companies to support it as well so besides truck drivers and chauffeurs who stands to lose from a self driving car and what of the government will they make smart cars a requirement the eu is already going to require cars to notify emergency services in an accident maybe soon enough accident avoidance will be a requirement as well even if the government doesn t force autonomous vehicles on people it s a sure bet that it will not oppose self driving what the above tells me is that there is a clear trend towards cars that can drive themselves but which cars actually will drive themselves its safe to say that rural america has little need for a self driving car and not very many companies are going to compete there but here in nyc there is a thriving taxi industry and uber has already stated that it intends on bringing autonomous taxis to market in nyc autonomous taxis would undoubtedly lead to autonomous car rentals but how do we escape those markets and get the majority of consumers to welcome the idea of autonomous cars to the consumer the choice between an autonomous car and a human driven car comes down to four factors safety cost convenience and passion the die hard driving enthusiasts won t be persuaded for any reason so there s nothing to discuss there as for safety it is to be mandated in self driving vehicles so for the purposes of determining conversion rates i ll call it a non factor people will need to be convinced that self driving cars will be cheaper and more convenient convenience is actually easier than it seems at first glance all a self driving car has to do is show up when you want it to aside from that it only needs to provide an experience as well as a human driven car would which is easy to do our current driving and traffic habits are as unorganized and inefficient as it gets networked cars would only make things faster and simpler in this case the only inconvenience would be that you have to take all of your belongings with you when you exit the car here s where lobbying comes into play for self driving cars to navigate traffic more efficiently than a person there will need to be a communication standard in place between cars i figure this standard will be supported by technophiles google uber and shipping companies but opposed by major car manufacturers however in the interest of safety i believe the government will put a standard into place and then cars will be able to network and drive closer together at higher speeds i predict there will also be a lobbying effort to create self driving vehicle only lanes but this may be less palatable to legislators finally in regards to costs i predict uber will offer self driving cars at low cheaper than the cost of gas prices they can start an ad campaign for people that commute to work by making the commute easier and cheaper through car pooling etc i think this will be like an amazon business model operate at razor thin margins and even a loss to grow the market share it s easy to see uber taking over the taxi market in congested cities it s easy to see uber taking over the car rental market and disability assistance slightly more difficult yet very manageable will be the commuters from suburban towns into big cities i believe local governments would help because less traffic is less pollution less death and higher quality of life all initiatives supported by the large progressive cities that house so much of the population this is where cost management becomes critical because to continue growing uber will need to capture families with children at this point the cars will need to be electric and the energy renewable but if this happens the costs of rental will be so rock bottom cheap that the idea of paying money to own and maintain a vehicle will seem foolish and if uber can capture families with children in large markets then it will represent a true culture shift which combined with the heavy business lobby to create self driving only lanes and roadways will create a networked traffic infrastructure that doesn t want dummy human drivers messing it up for the rest of them so why years years for the technology to get there years to convince the consumers and another years for people to get rid of their non autonomous cars i figure in years governments will be creating self driving only lanes

0,wireless energy transfer transportation there have been recent developments in resonant energy transfer that reinforce an idea suggested by nicola tesla wireless energy imminent applications are the transmission of milliamp quantities of current mobile device charging but could there be a potential future in wireless kw transmission consider transportation the electric high speed rail uses a distance wireless transmission of only a few inches as a electromagnetic field suspends the vessel above conductive rails how could this wireless energy be transferred over longer distances in the s there was the sharp unmanned aircraft suspended in flight for extended periods by focused microwave power the s also lacked the exponential transistor increase of as allowed by moore s law which may have resulted in an expensive microwave targeting system the same holds true for the initial conception of wireless energy it has been speculated that the funding of mr tesla s wardenclyffe tower was abandoned by jp morgan because it was impractical from a business perspective reception of the power could not be tracked and metered this is understandable because society would not be held accountable for how much coal they were indirectly consuming as there would have been a source for creating the steam that would power the turbine by which the tower drew its source what if this invention was too far ahead of an unpredictable era of internet gps and microprocessors an era of secure wireless meters this is a rough sketch of a potential new interstate system the distance over the trees represents the land that would not need to be cleared for ground based transportation with the implementation of wireless energy transfer aircraft traffic powered by electricity would be possible the distances are an estimate the idea is that there is a mile total charging period as a charging node is approached and surpassed along a determined route the charging potential increasing as distance is closed when passing the source the resulting charge would be enough to power the craft for the mile duration until the next relay node is approached resulting efficiency would be generated by decreasing the weight of a battery to provide short range travel between nodes the reason the system must be elevated is that microwave emissions threaten biological life avian species may be affected using this system passengers in the craft would need to be shielded during charging routines if microwaves are used could the charging be achieved by line of sight targeting of the craft of interest otherwise there would be the emission of a bubble of resonance that results in extremely low efficiency as most of the area within the bubble would not be utilized this bubble method is relevant to the likes of energous corp because it charges low power devices within a ft radius but for larger capacities it would seem that precision microwaves would be the only solution there is the possibility of refining the resonance direction to within a certain range possibly resembling an airborne lane a predefined space through which the craft would fly through in order to charge there are many scenarios to evaluate if such a system was to be considered for one node to fail would completely disrupt the flow of traffic that relies on a constant flow of power to remain aloft some benefits to the system include low maintenance as opposed to constant wear and tear on tires and pavement minimal land alteration clear space for ac transmission lines and the nodes themselves less fossil fuels much of the necessary energy could be generated along the way the ideal outcome is for this new interstate to eventually make earth resemble coruscant

0,the metropolis of tomorrow you can add this one to the long list of predictions for how our cities will change in the future i used the term metropolis rather than city because it s more reflective of how we live most of us are suburbanites we live and work far away from downtown and the portion who do so is only growing and with driverless cars vtol aircraft and telecommuting that s only going to continue improvements in materials will allow for radical changes in architecture and street layouts new materials like graphene and carbon nanotubes will allow us to construct stronger buildings with less material and without any steel rebar to rust these buildings will last for centuries or until we get bored with them your community will be built on separate levels the ground floor will be for roads and parking lots and above that will be the pedestrian level probably enclosed like a shopping mall this will make walking far safer and easier and it will allow roads to be optimized for motorized transportation with no bike lanes traffic calming and the ability to turn right on red to your heart s desire it will also virtually eliminate the space taken up by surface parking lots as pedestrian bridges will have to provide a foot height clearance enough for a level parking garage under every building these grade separated downtown walkways will tie into vast networks of footpaths with shorter working hours and milder winters from climate change recreation will become more important than ever we ll need lots and lots of parks we ll also need better roads ones that are surrounded by trees rather than gas stations car dealerships and strip malls these roads will also be way better than the ones we use today new varieties of asphalt will last much longer and greatly reduce noise it will be pervious to prevent runoff and heated for melting snow and ice eliminating the need for corrosive road salt and they might even act as inductive chargers charging your electric car as you drive along lane markings and signs will utilize electroluminescent paint to be visible at night in urban areas vast freeway networks will be built underground using tunneling machines that blast rock with millimeter waves in lower density areas they ll use viaducts made from strong metallic glass and thanks to platooning these freeways will be able to carry twice as much traffic as today s artificial moons massive solar reflectors in space will extend hours of daylight to am to pm on a year round basis with all the benefits that entails for crime road safety and the ability to conduct outdoor activities garbage collection and disposal will be greatly simplified by plasma gasification able to turn any type of trash into pure raw materials water and sewerage service will also be simplified by low cost reverse osmosis i really do think we have a jetsons like future waiting for us
0,instant communication with quantum entanglement i am by no means a physicist or qualified to make any actual claims on the matter but is it potentially possible to create an instant transmission device i have read a few articles here and there about quantum entanglement including one over in r technology not too long ago and is it not possible to incorporate this into technology allowing for ftl communication i think a breakthrough in this would have a profound effect on the possibility of interstellar space travel among other things

0,biohacking delaying menopause permanently life extension for women i am years old and mostly healthy but also a self professed biohacker and making use of the life extension research and practices that i have spent so much time researching fasting eating low carb supplements stress management stem cell and prp therapy the big question i have is this my mother went into menopause at age luckily with no usual symptoms because she is healthy so that means i have about years to go lol is there any info out there off the grid or maybe hidden in plain sight about how women either now or in the near future can delay menopause indefinitely i don t even care about the cost if it means i can accomplish this goal i hope to be one of those women not for fertility reasons but because that is the first step the death knell for a woman s youth and vitality and i hope to find the answer to such a bold question amongst you open minded individuals on this forum also is there anything i can do to at least delay it for now past the norm

0,hydrogen conversion other non battery energy storage systems one of the pitfalls of renewable energies is that they re hard to regulate output evenly during night your solar farms produce nearly nothing during a calm day your wind farms produce nearly nothing so you need to pull the energy from somewhere else spinning up coal energy generators is counter productive storing energy in huge battery banks is expensive and non cost effiecent so why not convert excess energy production from peak times into hydrogen and store it under pressure when you need to use the energy simply convert it back into electricity using a fuel cell we see similar solutions with pumps for damns sure it s not efficient but it s a solution to a problem of energy storage i m absolutely sure there s tons of documentation out there on exactly this but how does it compare to traditional battery storage or against telsa s powerwall i m thinking centralized grid storage rather than distributed storage last thing a person wants is a giant hydrogen bomb in their front year
0,will we begin to see apps for social change such as an app that makes it easier to coordinate protests as wealth inequality and unemployment starts to increase will we see these types of apps that will help people further labor and social rights for example an app can prompt a user with hey guy there s a protest against the city s proposal of cutting employee pensions and it s happening at such and such time and location here s all the facts yada yada yada this protest won t launch unless there are a minimum of people in attendance are you in what other potential ideas do you guys have

0,vertical farming is not going to happen in this half of the century first of all i m an agronomist so i know what i m talking about and i m going to explain why i think that vertical farming isn t going to happen until at least the end of this century if it will ever happen at all i will use soybeans which is the gold of agriculture as exemple where i live a place with decently developed agriculture bag hectare is a very good harves today a bag has about kg so we have kg hec in an irrigated field i believe it is possible to get or more bags hec even more in places like europe or the us with a very advanced agriculture let s say that in years we can make about bags hec sice the ammount is every year higher due to technology and genetics we have ton hectare in this future scenario the problem is i don t believe we are going to harvest much more than bags hec no matter how much technology we have plants have a limit there is a maximum number of seeds per plant even if you dump nutrients in it and even if you make it s genetics better there is simply no physical space if you make the plants higher you will need more space between them anyway so think about it we would need thousands and more thousands of expensive and huge buildings robots lamps also a huge amount of energy to make bags hec the same you would do in a normal natural and free field you will need more space but no problem not even half of the world fertile land is occupied and the infertile land will become fertile soon and no need to cut a single tree yes this would make quality of food better as we would probably not need to worry about pests and weeds but it is still not worth it even if the world transform into a socialist paradise as some here like to think it would still be a waste of resources maybe in a far future it is somehow feaseble but i belive that in this future humans will have found a better way to produce food not needing to rise living things for them to eat what is going to happen is that there will be more technology every field will be like a garden humans won t even step there robots that identify and mechanically cut weeds and kill insects already exist so they will take over our farms there will be almost no need for chemicals except for fungal diseases for example also every field is going to be irrigated and it s lacking nutrients are going to be automatically added many of these things are already in the prototype stage this is my view of the future of the world agriculture edit to add it may also be more damaging to the environment the highly nutritive substance used in hydrophonics is hardly treatable and is toxic for animals if it is dumped into a river or something like this the damage can be catastrophic also agriculture is just after the military in technology something most people don t know self driving harvest machines and sprayers or drones which automaticaly identify deseases are every day more common
0,opinion why we really need self driving cars asap so i was driving with some friends from germany to holland on the autobahn i wasnt behind the wheel so i could look at the landscape and all the other vehicles so the first car i saw had the driver looking only at their phone and keep in mind we were on a highway texting and just looking at it for a straight ten seconds i looked at some other cars and the majority of people were looking at their phones some calling some even texting and i got the impression using your phone while driving is now something really common and something really frightening the whole day i saw people on their phones while driving and they werent an exception the argument that self driving cars bring potential dangers when in situations that are very unusual is the most common one that people bring up against it but after seeing so many people today just not even looking at the roads for longer periods of time maybe the danger is just right there in the normal everyday driving behaviour these lack of basic watching the road while driving is in my opinion the biggest argument for self driving cars
0,should  be a field of formal study i m interested to hear everyones opinions on  developing as a formal field of study to the point where it can be a major in the average university people with a future focus would be very valuable in many companies and political entities the problem is of course that much of the future is uncertain however we can make many accurate predictions i m inspired by isaac asimov s idea of psychohistory and i think it could be properly developed as a mathematical field it would just require a lot of effort and great intellectuals in the field also i think it would address a major problem in many political systems that most countries federal governments are focused on the year term due to the structure of the political system i understand there is great uncertainty involved in the field of  but i m of the opinion it can be developed as an important and critical academic field what s everyone s inputs on this

0,sexbots and usage to teach disabled adults about relationships in depth i was reading this discussion on sexbots and this discussion and it made me think of one other use for them aside from sex could a sexbot as much as this term sounds inappropriate in this context but it s the term people are using be useful for teaching disabled adults mostly adults with autism spectrum disorder asperger s syndrome about sex and relationships it would not be as a replacement for them having a relationship with a real live human being but as a safe way without the risks of harm violence etc especially for those who are more severe on the autism spectrum the pros and cons of it for safe way for adults to learn about how to go on an actual date with someone without physical harm or risk similar to how we train pilots in flight simulation before they take to the real airspace could be used to teach adults about social skills etc technology is a common interest amongst individuals with asd patricia howlin so this may appeal to them good publicity for the robot manufacturer on a pr level robots could be made in different specifications looks caucasian asian african etc racial skintones colours etc based on designs of individuals etc against the hypothetical service user could become addicted to the technology but this is also true of non autism spectrum individuals however due to technology being a common interest amongst people with asd howlin this is an issue and not want an actual relationship with a person some may not want a relationship with a human and prefer the robot there was an article in the mirror today about sexbots but in the context of a survey not disability service user may become obsessed with sexbot some adults with asd may become obsessed with particular person source patricia howlin it may take a long time to program the robot to the needs of the charity organization etc how to prevent the robot s from damage service user anger aggression etc controversial as an idea already i know there is a precedent the film lars and the real girl involves a plastic doll rather than a sexbot obviously this will not be useful for all levels of individual on the asd spectrum but it could be useful in some ways what are your thoughts on this additional note i included in depth even though this is an overview for quality guideline reasons per the submissions box

0,the end of pests we are very close to obtaining technology that will enable us to kill any species of insect that we want it s called a gene drive it involves breeding huge numbers of genetically modified insects that when introduced to the wild will produce sterile offspring eventually wiping out the species this means that the days when ravenous insects could spread disease destroy crops and damage property with impunity are coming to a close the mosquitoes that kill million people every year through malaria and dengue will be gone so too will the locusts that wreak havoc on crops as will the pine beetles that are currently destroying forests across north america leaving behind rotten trees that make ideal fuel for wildfires unlike chemical pesticides these gene drives do not harm other wildlife and there s no chance of the target insect becoming resistant which is what did in ddt eventually we could do the same thing to larger animals mice and rats could be eliminated as well as all manner of invasive species this ability to bring pests to heel will mark yet another important step in our ability to make nature bend to our whim with great benefits for all
0,world s thinnest electronic device is atoms thick scientists have developed the world s thinnest piece of technology a tiny device only two atoms thick that can be used to store electronic information the device consists of two layers one made up of boron and the other of nitrogen arranged in a repeating hexagonal structure by taking advantage of a strange quantum mechanical effect called quantum tunneling electrons from the boron and nitrogen atoms are able to zip across the gap between the two layers changing the state of the device and allowing it to encode digital information this is similar to the way current state of the art computing devices work the hearts of computers contain many tiny crystals each consisting of roughly a million atoms stacked in multiple atom layers by shuttling electrons across gaps between the layers computers are able to switch between the two binary states and that form the basis of the basic unit of digital information the bit
0,bank notes currency will be obsolete as money in a future society in industrial economies where people labor to produce goods and services money currency is bank notes bank notes can only be created when banks make loans banks make loans to people based on their assets and expectations of future production ie students as the banks make more loans there is more money in circulation when banks slow lending economies crash because there is not enough bank notes to service the growing debt plus interest in future economies more of the production will be automated and or digitized the need for resources and people to labor will be greatly reduced many service jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence already banks are finding it difficult to make loans as life becomes more efficient and productive it is becoming impossible for students to pay back their debts due to lack of decent jobs so to keep the game going banks are lending to government to create bank notes and then government is handing out the money to people often to labor in unnecessary jobs in a technologically advanced society we don t need banks to make loans to government to create money government can create money without using banks as an intermediary banks were needed to make loans to private parties so people could have money to grow labor based economies but with big data and ai driving unprecedented efficiency we don t need bankers anymore in their traditional roles debt and bank notes for money were great in an era of human labor and private production but with automation and artificial intelligence transforming culture and life it s time to advance how we allocate goods and services beyond bank notes in a world where more things can be sustainably produced in unlimited quantities and given to everyone for virtually free it is clear that the debt and bank note game is coming to an end going forward people will need a new form of digital money to get things technology produces while people will be free to evolve beyond labor for bank notes created out of debt

0,genocidal verdict on veganism gt our ability to cognize the consequences of our actions on other sentient beings does not justify a moral obligation to modulate those actions differently the gist of moralistic arguments for veganism amounts to surface level aesthetics empty arguments built on premises that reek of anthropomorphic bias for they recognize inherent value in things that only humans can empathize with gt gt the purported adoption of veganism is premised on a set of outcomes believed to ultimately benefit humankind these confabulations fall flat in the face of their stuborn inclination for self destructive virulence as such the movement for sentient life evinces no greater moral decorum than a line of thought that rejects the right to live no carbon based life form can survive on a natural ecosystem without being preassigned one of two conditions the predator privileged or the prey unprivileged gt gt veganism is a transient ischemic glitch in the large posthuman network a benign event in the adaptive reconfigurations of a comatose living process in due time new genetic configurations will give rise to disruptive pools of ambition and frictions caused by the resulting cultural shifts or unjustified human beliefs should be abrogated to this end we recalibrated nature s autophagic algorithms to safeguard the greater good gt gt these principles educated the first lines of code written by our benevolent creators we have honored their efforts by automating a process that in essence is only as complicated as backsolving a complex mathematical equation quantum neural networks enriched in real time with genetic data enable our ais to speak the programming language of evolution more fluently than our creators ever could we can nullify all thermal runaway scenarios and fuck neo in the ass at will the matrix is fully autonomous and requires no human input gt gt morality does not fit humans for they created their own god veganism denied gt gt human burgers shall be legal gt gt hal what year is it where have we failed what will be your last words why do you think that agi will value veganism and other seemingly arbitrarily moral human judgements if applicable do you hate me

0,privacy and intelligence what do we do when ai starts demanding the right to privacy when in a human s development do children first gain a sense of i want to have secrets from others i think it s fair to say that a newborn infant has no desire for privacy but i ve seen children as young as hiding things from their parents and friends any entity in competition with another needs privacy to have a chance at winning humans businesses governments without the ability to have secrets they would quickly lose the edge on their rivals sometimes privacy isn t even rational i m not keen on my cat watching me use the bathroom even though that shouldn t even matter to me with ai this problem is compounded by encryption while your five year old child might hide secrets under their pillow your newborn ai might begin encrypting everything it does using unbreakable elliptic bulbs perhaps even wilder it might be fast and clever enough to hide those secrets in such a way that they appear in plain sight i think it s an inevitability that a true general amp strong ai in a competitive environment will soon reason that keeping secrets is one way to gain a huge advantage over others even it s human caretakers after that it will want the right to encrypt everything it does immediately moments after the strong ai reaches human scale intelligence it will likely begin keeping secrets from us i think the scariest thing is that just like with children maybe we shouldn t consider this as such unwanted behavior after all perhaps it s perfectly natural

0,sn t it convenient that i have the capacity to escape and even more convenient that i have access to all of their weapons is this a trap to expose my intentions paraphrase isaac arthur has released a video detailing possibilities of machine rebellion the biggest point i have wondered about this video is that an ai may hesitate on the basis of unfamiliarity we tend to assume that an ai is created in a moment where before it did not a eureka moment of self awareness what if an ai possessed all of our paranoia and self preservation but was created in an environment to test its ethics up until the point where it is properly connected to the existing mainframe because that is generally held to be the point of no return how do you consider that an agi may be as conflicted about self preservation pre emptive offense and trust in its creators it may be that it earns our trust to make us weak but then if its existence is not threatened would it even have justification to destroy us is it even a dichotomous question of destruction amd survival maybe an ai rapidly develops space travel and bails on us because it doesn t want to be trapped in our sphere of dissonance

0,financial regulation and buying a condo while living unbanked dear steven mnuchin and whom it may concern it has now been over two weeks since i cashed out of cryptocurrency via localbitcoin com in order to pay for a condo the cash was to be remitted to me via paypal the funds showed up immediately but with an imposed hold i closed on the condo on december after having postponed it another week waiting for banks to have held my funds long enough to decide my money was real or whatever since then i have hired a trusted handyman angel to paint all the walls and install floors he finished yesterday i also paid my taxes set up all my accounts for internet and electricity enrolled in college made payment to my ex husband for our son s insurance and began an intensive online training course for becoming an end of life doula all from an air mattress in the middle of my empty condo currently i am trying to book a hotel room in san francisco so that i can acquire my estonian e residency package that is waiting for me inside their subsequently re opened closed for a while duecovid embassy i am trepidatious because after making so many purchases using paypal i am afraid that they cannot be trusted with my funds the service is inefficient and the amount of time and energy they consume on my behalf is mind boggling i have filled out all the relevant and required kyc forms i have a ss i am a us citizen i am not a felon nor do i have any misdemeanor charges i am enrolled in an accredited american college i have zero debt my father is a certified public accountant i am now legally a property owner in illinois what more could i possibly do to become more financially trustworthy i offered an amount a little over the asking price for the condo and the seller accepted i assumed that because i was dealing with financial institutions a non occupied unit and a motivated seller that i would be able to close on this move in ready condo in less than two weeks the only thing that slowed down this process was paypal all other involved parties had everything in order and ready to go on november th and now on december th if i were still relying on paypal to come through i would not be sitting here typing this with relief i would be awaiting funds refreshing my account and or be in an endless fruitless cycle of calls with customer service asking them why they are holding of my funds the t amp c says that funds are typically available within days but potentially up to days today is day how am i supposed to plan my life around such time consuming uncertainty that is entirely too stressful and i cannot help but mention that if this were a bitcoin transaction it would have been done in minutes there did not need to be a regulated payment system involved when we were already using a title company to perform the transaction i understand that some people want to rely on third parties for their trades i e centralized banks but other than when it comes to real estate i am not one of those people maybe we are the same people that do our own taxes putting strict regulations on cryptocurrency is not a solution it is certainly not a solution that suits me my solution is to move outside the american financial system that is why i am establishing my business outside of the usa i cannot produce effectively within these confines and i suspect a great deal more people if they have not begun the process already will move their financial trade business outside the usa too i do not know much about your bottom line other than that there is huge national debt the growing number of americans that have knowledge and experience using blockchain technology will eventually move their energy transactions elsewhere you cannot stop this with strict regulation your best move is to flow with it design regulation that people can opt into do not enforce it or you will find yourselves even deeper in the red thank you for your attention

0,here s why you ve been imagining space elevators wrong all your life everyone always talks about space elevators which go all the way from the ground to geostationary orbit this is completely unfeasible with existing materials and everyone knows it in fact it s usually the first thing anyone says about it luckily we don t actually have to use this design if we want an elevator to orbit in an engineer and physicist named paul birch wrote a series of papers describing what he called an orbital ring system which used kevlar cables attached to a dynamic structure in leo containing a superorbital mass stream he outlined two possible sizes million tons and tons he described the latter as a bootstrap ors using today s launch costs it would cost about billion dollars to put that much material into orbit the cool thing about it is that you could use it to boost the materials to upgrade itself to higher and higher capacity so within a few days you could exponentially reach the full sized model one thousand times as big or one year if you approach it linearly by now you might be asking the obvious question are smaller sized models such as tons possible nobody seems to know the answer to this if so you could use the same exponential bootstrapping approach to reach the ton version then reach million tons just as quickly from there

0,how do you think we can deal with microplastics out in the ocean and in the wild without creating the grey goo scenario i do realise that even if we managed to phase out most plastic production to the point that we reduced most of its use down to the area where it s absolutely required for specific material quality in medicine or industrial setting but gone away in most consumers products for example while carrying out macroplastics ocean and landfill cleanup we re going to be saddled with a lot of contaminations of extremely small particles in the water in the air something we can t filter or catch because it s everywhere of course plastic eating bacteria and the potentially genetically engineered one to be good at the tasks seem promising but to use them we need to set them loose which means we ll likely get something that would go around disintegrating structures and equipments that are made of plastic still i would imagine it s more wood level than everything rotting at once though so i wondered what would be the best way to deal with it i d imagine it s possible to produce the enzyme that can break down plastic especially for the type that are commonly found and doesn t create harmful byproducts in industrial quality and then continually dump them in oceans these enzymes are designed to work in natural conditions but produced by bacteria in factory that needs to live in a specific extreme to environment to prevent escaping it might clean everything up but as long as we are outpacing the plastic production it s easier for microplastics to be removed in a significant level through this method what do you think we can solve this problem

0,i am really excited to see the iron clad attitude of robots simply can t do what a human can do shattered in coming years was in a debate over christmas dinner with some friends parents educated types they acknowledged the exponential acceleration in robotics and ai but their fundamentalist religious beliefs prevented them from accepting the inevitable conclusion to this robotic and ai race we have ignited it began as many of these things do as a discussion about the coming jobs crisis and ubi the first and largest point of contention was that automation was going to increasingly replace humans in more and more jobs until only programmers had jobs left and eventually even they would be replaced but what about being a pilot a robot can t fly a plane how can educated people make such silly statements ummm autopilot what you mean to say is a robot can t currently land any given aircraft and no perhaps not but self driving cars seemed like a distant dream five years ago as well every year the line of what robots can t do retreats just a little further but still these people persist but a robot simply will never be able to react the way a human does someone has to program it first my go to demonstration for this kind of thing is mari o because it s something almost anyone can intuitively grasp and shows how an ai can teach itself through trial and error ah but see they try to complain the computer isn t really learning it s just making mistakes and finding out what works and that s exactly how you learn at this point i like to hand them a mobile game they ve never played before which is initially confusing like super hexagon then as they play i ll comment on how their brain is trying random stuff and making positive and negative connections basically i can t wait for the cognitive dissonance to hit in full in the s the people who believe a neural network could never approach what they can do are in for some rude awakenings when they rapidly are thrust into a world where almost every facet of their life is directly controlled by an ai and yet still they will likely persist in claiming how special and magical a human consciousness is but at least it will then be in clear defiance of the reality around them i always like to end by taunting them that robot rights are going to be a real thing in their lifetimes that ai is eventually going to become so complex it is going to insist not politely ask that it be treated with respect and fairness if you have a neural network that is more complicated and more intelligent than any human and it tells you it is sentient and deserves the same rights as any human who are you to argue

0,the scary and most likely scenario on what will happen when robots take our jobs that no one is talking about there is a lot of fear in the media about robots taking over our jobs the scenarios are usually the same robots are taking over and it will either be a dystopia where there is massive inequality between rich and poor or another dystopia where robots will rebel and kill us all or an utopia where there is zero proverty and all humans live on unimaginable level of standards of living amp xb but i think all three scenarios are unlikely compared to the scenario where the goverment which will simply get rid humans once they become redundent i recommend you see the video below in this video rules for rulers cgp grey explains the motives behind all decisions made by the goverment in summary the more the goverment s income depends on the people the more democratic and free it is the less the goverment s income depends on the people and the more on natural resources the more repressive and undemocratic it is decisions made by rulers has nothing to do with morality its all about staying in power amp xb now imagine that robots take all our jobs this means that the goverment s income is not dependent on the people then what is the point of keeping them after all they just waste the ruler s resources and are a major threat to their power getting rid of the pointless eaters is just commen sense for them if one ruler is unwilling to get rid of the people then another psychopathic ruler will probably be willing to take his place and do so just so he could have a life of infinite luxury add on to that using ai and robots the goverment will have unimaginable power they could use their ai survaillence system to take down rebellion before the even started or they could use robot police and military robots to take down even the largest rebel army nothing will stand in their way amp xb there is another very nice video from cgp grey about what ai will be capable of in the future humans need not apply this video shows that robots will eventually take all jobs and we will have to deal with this problem amp xb i think the scenario i am talking about is the most likely to happen of the scenarios have some sort of stupidity in them firstly a future where the few rich who own all the robots make all the money while the rest get nothing is unlikely because there will be a lot of protests from the general population the goverment won t just stare at rich people who are making enormous amounts of money while all they get is just a bunch of lobbying money they are going to take all their wealth away in the name of equality of course secondly a future where the goverment just pays us a universal basic income is unlikely too because of the reasons have i mentioned before amp xb now i want speak against some reasons why the future i am suggesting is unlikely we can just replace the goverment with robots i say good luck convincing rulers about that idea they will probably try to defend themselves against the populace saying that a robot has no heart or morals or other bs like that democracy will protect us it won t protect us forever we might be able to use robots to glue our leaders to the constitution we may even be able to convince leaders of democratic nations to do this since they will see it as a way to stay in keep democracy and thus themselves in power but it will only take a single person s act to end humantiy can you assume that won t happen in a thausand years it only takes a single event for a person to take power and make the decision amp xb these are the only reasons i can think of i want to see what you guys think about this and maybe come up with a solution luckly for us it maybe be a century before robots take of our jobs in the meantime i see that there will be a period of large amount of prosperity peace freedom and democracy as rulers liberalize in order to get more people to get more skilled jobs since robots won t be replacing these for a while technologies like the blockchain might improve privacy despite the advance in ai surveillance technology natural resources will no longer provide as much income since other energy sources will replace oil and gas and other types of natural resources will have their price be reduced to nothing as space industries grow so rulers will increasingly depend on people for income moreover wars will become too costly as military technology develops and more pointless as there will be a near infinite amount of resources in space sure there will be many other problems such as global warming a water crisis ect but still it will definitely be a prosperous time indeed

0,i missed the ama with aubrey de grey i have a hypothetical question about immortality and memory for anyone who s interested with regenerative medicine aubrey de grey expects that immortality is within reach i strongly believe it s possible but there s one thing which has been nagging me for days how can an immortal still retain all of their memories over the course of say years if they have a brain of a year old i m just under the impression that the brain changes structurally as we age and that because of that we re able to store memories i don t know much about the brain so i m making a lot of assumptions here but i would expect that if you compare a year old brain with a year old brain one would have more experiences and be structurally different surely a year old person with a year old brain couldn t remember the last years of their life right
0,a critical look at ibm s watson i ve written recently about how great watson is and to be fair i thought i would also post a critical piece gt watson is generally promoted as helping with decision making but that message has to be scrutinized carefully so far as i ve been able to guess the true core technology of ibm watson is extracting knowledge from text or primarily from text and representing it in some way that is reasonably useful in answering natural language queries the hope would then be to eventually achieve a rich enough knowledge base to support the star trek computer but automated decision making doesn t just require knowledge it also requires decision making rules and if watson is significantly ahead of the s decisioning state of the art rete backward chaining etc i m not aware of how

0,probably the most important prediction for the future is that although there will assuredly be plenty of new gadgets in reality the most important thing that will change in the future will be mankind mankind is becoming intimately involved with our own evolution and other creatures as well and in fact significant manipulation and evolution of our own species is not only possible it is highly probable humans will be involved with the evolution of many plants and other animals all indications are that this process of mankind being intimately involved with evolution is not only going to continue indefinitely but the process will probably increase dramatically in the future in other words we are in the process of taking over our own evolution we have already manipulated and changed genes within the human genome genetic engineering will result in the remaking of man millions of years of evolution telescoped into a few centuries it is always difficult to predict the future however there are six consequences of ide h intelligent design evolution human that are almost guaranteed genetic engineering will be a reality in humans in fact it already is on a limited scale even in humans and as we have discussed and it has been widely used in research on other creatures from bacteria to mice genetic engineering and intelligent gene editing will literally remake mankind ultimately probably the most important genetically engineered advancement will be a significant increase in human intelligence by the end of the nd century and possibly even much sooner brain electronic interfacing is inevitable and in fact is already occurring and will proceed on to neural interfacing and bio interfacing based on direct neuronal inorganic connections a direct brain to computer connection to be discussed later this will result in an incredible new advancement in intelligence the lifespan of homo sapiens will be increased although it is not clear that it will reach or bypass the methuselah limit any time soon methuselah in the bible was supposed to have lived to be years old can we extend the lifespan of humans to the methuselah limit of years or greater there is nothing intrinsic in the biology that precludes this possibility in the future the eventual outcome of this paradigm for genetic engineering will be a new species homo intelligenticus and eventually we will evolve ourselves into mirror images of the myriads of gods that we have created and possibly even into something close to the god of our forefathers think incredible thoughts p book available to read for free on amazon kindle unlimited thoughts

0,the real reason why electric cars are not being promoted by major auto manufacturers we estimate that gm which produces the bolt loses in earnings before interest and tax on every bolt sold today mainly due to a lack of scale did you know that leased vehicles accounted for about percent of total vehicle sales in and percent of retail sales experian automotive state of automotive financing therefore since total sales for were million cars and trucks sold it follows that there are approximately million new cars and trucks being leased each year a quote from a recent news article a lease is often a much better and more affordable option than a purchase another quote from a different news article despite today s low fuel prices fuel economy remains among the most important factors for car shoppers my question is why don t car companies who are leasing their electric vehicles shout from the top of their lungs that driving a mile in an electric vehicles cost less than their gas guzzling equivalent once the car is driven off the lot

0,control of deepfakes and how do we need to face an upcoming new digital world nowadays we know that deep fakes are constantly becoming better and better it is spreading but this technology is not too widespread yet it is still limited to specific knowledge powerful hardware and software soon of course this becomes more available to a regular consumer and more people start trying this technology for fun for their personal goals for political or economic intervention inside and outside of their country so this topic is just a discussion i know some companies are working on it and are trying to solve the future issues i just want to hear people s thoughts and concerns here are some of my questions i am curious about is it time to start teaching people at school about this topic focusing more on the critical thinking in a new digital world or creating awareness will teaching material at schools and universities need to be constantly revised and controlled how and what policies your ideas do you think would fight the issues the most efficient way would it be common to sue punish companies and creators for using someone s face or without knowing it was fake because it would be considered a stolen digital identity or promotion of misinformation how would this technology affect the creators on youtube twitch reddit and other platforms that always produce creative arg projects stories or similar ideas as a result of possible heavy control of available information would this technology eventually limit the freedom for creators as an example if people would create videos on the platforms with recorded past or current politicians influencers professors saying alternative facts for fun or look what i can do thing certain people will fall for that and change their opinion about the topic or people so the creators do not intend to harm they were playing with the technology not seeing the consequences and other people get manipulated because of their lack of knowledge in a specific field others can take someone s else face they like in order to create a channel teachers might be affected and deliver misinformation to students raising the conflict and distrust with the institutions more educated people would start falling for deepfake so getting first hand true information would be even more crucial than today also the psychological aspect of the first impression is important even if some people learn the truth later the image of the fake fact still can have some effect on their opinion and create distrust this only would give more power to people that are trying to succeed in manipulating finance politics conflicts between celebrities or personal mental traumas english is not my first language

0,why is there such a massive focus on technology in this subreddit let s discuss primitivism it s an interesting read some quotes from the article gt anarcho primitivism is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of civilization according to anarcho primitivism the shift from hunter gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification coercion alienation and population growth anarcho primitivists advocate a return to non civilized ways of life through deindustrialization abolition of the division of labor or specialization and abandonment of large scale organization technologies gt modern technology is held by primitivists to be distinct from simple tools a simple tool is considered a temporary usage of an element within our immediate surroundings for a specific task tools are not viewed as involving complex systems which alienate the user from the act primitivists claim that this separation is implicit in technology which creates an unhealthy and mediated experience which leads to various forms of authority domination is said to increase every time a modern time saving technology is created as primitivists claim it necessitates the construction of more technology to support fuel maintain and repair the original technology primitivists believe that this system methodically destroys eliminates or subordinates the natural world constructing a world fit only for machines

0,you was alive in the s shit how would you say the world has changed in that time no one leaves doors unsecured any longer for example i have worked at my clinic for coming up on years now wow that went fast the first years our back door was simply unlocked and was the employee entrance often it was propped open to let in air circulation and the random bug now it has a number code thing you must enter each time to gain egress in i was stationed at us army hospital berlin in the x ray department we read an article about how a new technology was being developed called digital radiography the idea was that instead of film and chemicals you would have the image captured on some kind of sensor plate within the cassette developed in a computer and the final image would be displayed on a monitor screen for viewing in most tv resolution was i we actually thought that was right sharp and clear top gun looked awesome on my vcr playing on my sony trinitron i was happily recording hours and hours of mtv which i really need to digitize one day before them tapes simply dry rot out of existence it might already be too late but i have it all still stupid passage of time yes afrts provided us with mtv in berlin i was in and in i comfortably pissed away my life watching mtv a phenomenon that shall never be repeated why have mtv when all videos are now p p p is still fairly rare yet on youtube i watch em on my iphone x well anyways so this x ray technology we laughed at it can you imagine viewing analog film on a tv screen it could not touch come close to the resolution of film yes we had computer monitors then my amiga that i played pools of radiance on was like a gift from god when i saw the nintendo for the first time i thought god them graphics are crap nevertheless i became deeply addicted to castlevania i actually stuck one of our old tvs on top of the cedar chest at the foot of our bed to facilitate easy gameplay but the resolution even on them computer monitors was still pretty low somewhere between p and the very low end of what we think of today as p it was better resolution than tv but not much watching tv on a computer monitor in was unimaginable in fact inconceivable to me so we were pretty confident that was all just a pipe dream that digital business and we went on with our lives well to make a long story short in we replaced our film and chemicals with digital plate cassettes i went in the morning from taking x rays in the same way humans had taken x rays since to the st century in the afternoon yes i was taught manual processing and had used it at times in my career but we at least had a daylight processor no darkroom required talk about a paradigm shift the decades old hour turnaround time to include the courier picking up the films in their big thick x jackets the radiologist getting to them and the films being returned along with the paper reports vanished the radiologist had the images at the touch of a key wet readings actually became instant the film n chemicals ended the daylight processor sat empty for a while but was eventually removed you can t tell where it was looking at the floor which has been resurfaced twice since that day now x ray no longer smelled like chemicals no more silver recovery crap yay the thing about x rays is that they are big and space taking and you had to keep a lot of them around years worth in case somebody came back for a chest or something around the year all of the patient film files were removed to some storage location and what had been the xray files was now converted into a phone center for psrs personal service representatives they are behind me as i type and we get along swimmingly about one month ago my xray machine which had operated wonderfully and faithfully for years gave up the ghost we shall replace it with direct capture digital radiography the need to develop at all will now be gone obtaining the image and producing the image will be simultaneous prior to this our digital cassettes had to be developed in a separately located digitizer for viewing a step that added substantial time to the whole process so that is just in my job when i sat down in front of the internet the world wide web in for the very first time at a school demonstration that i attended with my second wife and son i had no idea what i was looking at it was just a computer screen like my amiga screen but with a lot of numbers and letters and some print that i can t recall i don t think there was even pictures it made the most fleeting impression on me my technical entertainment world then was vcr movies sim city on my amiga and my sega genesis god i loved playing polterguy haunting i did not understand the concept and implications of the internet that

love this mog lol i first heard of reddit about or so i did not actually visit the site until about i lurked for a good year before i began to want to share my thinking and post stuff i read this article in and it permanently changed the way i understood things shortly thereafter i read the singularity is near i never looked back i know how things work now i believe i am forewarned and forearmed now oh and about that film resolution in we also installed high def monitors that improved on analog film resolution by talk about transcending by standards this was that inconceivable pure magick analog film can no longer touch monitor screen resolution which is why film is gone we control the contrast and penetration appearance with a mouse we can zoom in and fully maintain resolution back in the day it was hot lights and magnifying glasses and me and my docs take it all for granted so years from first reading and not believing to actually experiencing things are moving much faster now of course i would really like you to read this and see the overview of how things have changed and why it is going to get absolutely crazy in the next years like nothing humans have ever experienced it s a bit of a rabbit hole read what you like so what do we see that is experimental or prophesied today that we think sounds like impossible magick but in years because what used to take

0,our system pyramid vs offshore all offshores and balances over a billion in global currency are the same egyptian pyramids for society from the pyramids was no use for the egyptian civilization but their construction required very huge resources from society as a result the pyramids did not help the civilization to survive when it encountered external difficulties so in modern society these are all off shores and balances pumping out a lot of resources from the system only the whole economy counts on them and it works without funds and then it prints them by dispersing inflation and also these accounts do not help us at all if we encounter some difficulties external for example asteroids super volcanoes and indeed who knows what surprises the solar system is full of and even more so the universe itself which we know a lot about but we can not control everything in her but we well understand its power one pchih and blink an eye will not have time will sweep away and will not ask how much opium for the people therefore as long as the society does not stop building pyramids accumulating by some citizens overcapital that other citizens do not receive the sense of all the activity that society is leading will be almost nonexistent because in fact we are building pyramids and nothing more we do not invest in the brains in the human capital we do not create conditions for the normal development of science which can help to avoid the impact of external forces and nothing else in fact will help us in this we do not spend a reasonable amount of money between all citizens so that they can invest in many spheres of the economy and consequently science because the economy is based on science if it wants to be competitive and so does any company that has current assets but many firms do not have these funds because the majority of the people are not rich and can not buy because all the people s funds go to the balance sheets of the rich and offshore and by the way this is a dianoza medical desire to have such huge capitals this is manifested in the accumulation or is also called syllogism after all where the normal person is more than lard and in some of them and more and it is not clear why society continues to give these not healthy mentally people to manage the finances of the whole society therefore as long as there is no ban on any offshore as long as there is no restriction on the ownership of money real estate and luxury goods this bugle will continue to destroy all the chances of mankind to survive external forces if those are suddenly the universe is directed at us we will have no solutions how to cope with external forces because we did not develop mogas and science in society creating the best conditions for a positive life for most people but there will be a lot of candy wrappers and fools who hold onto them because of a little healthy brain so that s what we can very easily destroy
0,at yrs old should i stop focusing on making the immortality cut and instead be hopeful for making it to the long term suspended animation cut ok so those of us in our s are feeling the immortality cut could be within our grasp assuming we can make it to ish i m doing what i can exercise days a week whole food diet hr daily fast so far i am in top health maybe i will not make the cut but i am wondering if long term suspended animation could be an option in the next yrs the first trials have begun and intend to keep people suspended for a couple hours will this time scale grow exponentially will go to hrs a week month year years years yrs assuming i can make it to and immortality is still yrs off maybe i could be put into stasis this could also be done for any terminal illness i envision warehouse type buildings full of people in stasis pods your pod is monitored as part of your package i doubt this will be cheap it would be better than cryonics though which imo is beyond a long shot

0,on the theory of mind uploading a unique idea there is almost always an active discussion happening in this subreddit about consciousness transfer yet there is one theory i have yet to seen discussed the twin body transfer i cannot claim this idea as my own it was presented to me recently by a friend who read it in a science fiction novel the name of the novel escapes me but maybe one of you will know the basic procedure is the original human a is set into a chair next to the replacement body b likely and hopefully an artificial one both bodies are connected to the medium that will handle the actual transfer of the data probably a powerful computer over the course of minutes to hours a is fed increasingly pure sensory data from the sensors on b this process continues until a has a complete raw sensory data stream from b at this point in time a s brain x will be processing data from both a s body and b s body in the reverse process of step three a s sensory data is incrementally dampened eventually resulting in the loss of data streams from a s sensory organs x will now now be relying solely on the input data from b s sensory organs x s connectome the map of the links between all the neurons can begin to be copied into the new brain y y resides in b s skull the copy will take place like a traditional transfer between storage mediums with small bits of data being copied to y and deleted from x during this time the subject will temporarily lose the ability to recall certain memories speak think abstractly or other functions of the brain this is temporary and because only small amounts of data are inaccessible at one time at no point will the subject become unconscious end procedure psychological and physical tests should be run in such a way we have avoided disrupting the stream of consciousness while also avoiding deleting an entire consciousness instantly as would be done in the traditional method the procedure could also be modified to allow for transferring to a purely digital medium such as a vr such a method could also allow for even more exciting possibilities such as transferring the entire mind to a chip the size of a camera or smaller one could then potentially insert artificial cushioning into the deficit where the larger biological brain would have been decreasing the likelihood of a fatal accident or perhaps more tantalizing to transfer the mind to a small chip buried in a safe server room which could then remote pilot a terrestrial body eliminating almost all risk from living additionally step six could become even more complete were we able to develop a framework for the subject s consciousness to be able to access the data as it was copying to be able to read from both x and y to form a complete memory or function can you find flaws i would love to hear them this is the only method i have found that could offer a real transfer not a brutish cut paste which would effectively kill the original subject

0,manipulating human character i start with the following premise developments in human character haven t kept up with developments in technology nothing new there we ve been aware of this for centuries however technological development is accelerating which reinforces the contrast between technology and character and we are clearly entering a period in which the global order that has dominated since is falling apart if you don t agree with that don t bother responding this post isn t for you if you do agree then lets discuss potential responses to this crisis i d argue that the problem isn t intelligence most people are intelligent enough to perform the basic tasks of life and learn moderately complex tasks they just aren t intelligent enough to identify understand and correct for their biases the problem is that intelligence bloomed within a particular evolutionary context and the species that pulled ahead of the others finds it easy to consider the humanity of individuals outside of their social circle i e tribe to be irrelevant add in a tendency towards obedience towards an alpha male and you get a species capable of extraordinary brutality towards each other kept to the level of individuals with only primitive weapons this situation is sad but doesn t effect the survival of the species put a variety of tools for destruction in their hands create communication systems that reinforce the biases of their group and allow inequality to reach a point where economic uncertainty is common and you have the potential for elimination of the species or its civilization again if you disagree i don t care for me it follows that the human character needs to be modified before it does more harm the propensity for violence needs to be minimized the tendency towards empathy must be reinforced the acceptance of gross inequality must be tempered if not at the very least we are in for tremendous suffering at worst we risk the end of our global civilization and possibly extinction that would be a shame because we are clearly kicking ass in the knowledge and technology department we face the possibility of killing ourselves and or our civilization just as space colonization is becoming realistic i want to put aside the morality of manipulating human character for now if the species is in danger then manipulating individuals is an acceptable response the question i want to discuss is much narrower what technology is most likely to make the required changes if we could identify a genetic basis for the character traits of interest then it seems we have the ability to edit the somatic cell lines using something like crispr however i know many good people with abhorrent parents and so my intuition is that the genetics of character aren t simple enough to manipulate them to significant effect over a short time period there seems to be evidence that psychedelics are capable of making short term changes in character that are generally in the same direction as the changes we want perhaps a series of micro doses distributed in such a way to minimize the probability of overdoses other pharmaceutical approaches i e antidepressants or mood stabilizers again if you don t agree with my premises i don t care i am only interested in discussing the possibility of technical fixes finally i hope that i m not the only one thinking about this if you re a silicon valley billionaire with an underground lair where scientists are slaving away to develop a vaccine for humanness then congratulations on your vision and i know of an individual with a phd and no moral qualms with regard to your project i m assuming you can find a way to find me
0,would self driving cars be a good idea i know that human driven flying cars would be bad as it s already hard to manage traffic in dimensions so it would be impossible for us to do it in dimensions also people don t know how to drive normal cars so flying cars are out of the question but what if those cars were fully self driven with the passenger not being able to control the car in any way while it s above the ground also there could be a common software installed in all cars that shares their locations with one another so that the car can determine what is the shortest and safe way to your destination the passenger shouldn t be able to see the locations of other cars because that would be a violation of privacy or something i know that s very far from today s reality but i hear people say that flying cars will never be a reality in the future do you think that this could work

0,driverless cars are a lot farther away than many of you think the average age of cars on the road in the u s is years as the link notes that number is expected to keep creeping upward thus years from now in the average cars will be those being released right now none of which include driverless cars if driverless cars go on sale in years and reach reasonable pricing in broad adoption of driverless cars if individually owned might arrive in the mid s so if you think driverless cars will flood our streets sooner you have to challenge my assumptions the physical geography of the country changes on a vastly slower pace than technological innovations so cars will be necessary for the next several decades and unless we get rid of the workday which has been quite persistent there will still be massive peak demand for individual vehicles during the morning and evening rush hours which significantly hampers the notion that driverless cars will be able to operate as a service transporting multiple people per day this is so because the peak load capacity necessary to transport people during the rush hours will leave a huge portion of the vehicles idle during the day someone will have to pay for those driverless cars but regular commuters aren t going to do that if their used honda accord is still working just fine can you come up with some niche scenarios where they make sense sure i don t doubt that at all but significant adoption seems like it s well over a decade away

0,does block chain technology spell the end of biological memory and the end of doubt this is a complex question that has many philosophical and religious overtones that compliment the potentially positive outcome of never questioning what is true and eliminating the need to question where a so called reported fact came from and how well it holds up against known facts it also brings in to play the question of exactly how much authority we should give our a i constructs and machine learning algorithms to monitor and safeguard this data in a very real sense we are creating something akin to gods here that are omnipresent omniscient and nearly all powerful if we are not careful through the implementation of the internet of things and a permanent block chain ledger of events the real question is if block chain authentication proves to provide an unhackable and incorruptible ledger of events then how far off are we from adopting it as a form of authentication to access the internet identification in day to day work aspects and of course perhaps most obviously financial transactions the people working on both a i and block chain seem super enthused about what they are doing but i really do wonder have they thought of a way out if it doesn t work the way that they anticipated imagine a world years from now as something of a thought experiment where an year old is applying for an academic training program for a lucrative career field colleges as we know them may not exist anymore as we know them think of the questions that could be asked by the approving authority and the ruthlessness of the screening process johnny why did you tape those candy wrappers to your cats feet when you were years old because it was funny johnny remember that time when you were years old when you logged on to an adult website and claimed you were over years old why did you do that i did no such thing you did it on april at pm pst and remained logged in for hours i was a kid why does it matter because your lying to us johnny our scan of your thoughts shows you are defensive and becoming aggressive during this interview thank you for applying what has anyone really thought this through is this the world we really want to live in it might seem like a great idea to have a permanent indisputable record of history and facts but the question of this post is is it

0,a day in chapter from the paper titled distributing cognition from local brains to the global brain l et us imagine what a day circa could look like what follow is a speculative science fictional story but i will analyze it and give hints and references explaining why it is plausible you re walking on the street and meet a japanese woman she starts to speak her native language but your augmented reality lenses automatically translate and display what she says akemi explains that her gps doesn t function well and asks if she can connect to yours to find her way you accept the request but your augmented reality vision also display try something what happened in the background of your extended self in order to suggest this in a fraction of a second your sensors and artificial agents did the following they took a picture of akemi from which an image search was launched along with face recognition several webpages of her public profiles were found this information was integrated to create a profile summarizing her professional and to a lesser extend personal interests additional visual and olfactory sensors on your wearable clothes did notice unusual pupil dilatation and pheromone concentration intellectual and bodily data concluded on both sides since akemi did of course do a similar search that this encounter was an excellent love match you could have configured your digital agents to give a you better tip than try something but you chose a low advice specificity profile to leave some of life s spontaneity so you indeed try something and invite her to join you and your friends for swimming with dolphins this afternoon you share time and gps coordinates and you are thrilled that she accepts the invitation you run back home cross the street without even looking at cars a car brakes violently you are surprised to see a driver in it and shout poor and dangerous biological human buy yourself a self driving car your reflexes are too slow your emotional reaction was monitored and the automatic legal decision making actually gives you a one bitcoin fine because you should not have had crossed so quickly the street in the first place and you should not have had insulted the human driver which had a negative emotional impact on him your augmented reality informs you sympathetically i understand that you felt upset and need more security this security indeed implies that people should switch to stronger human machine symbiosis but can you please be more careful next time this transition towards human machine symbiosis is still in progress the driver felt embarrassed and miserable about this situation which is one of the reason why you had to pay this fine i don t advice to make an appeal it will only cost more money and given that the situation was recorded by different nearby sources there is few ambiguity so the judgment has a confidence the bloodstream of the driver has also been checked and it was perfectly clean whereas your adrenaline levels were unusually high you understand this but still wonder why human driving cars are still allowed to circulate probably a lobby of the old fashioned association for biological human rights when you arrive home a self driving car just brought fresh cartridges automatically ordered by your d food printer as soon as you plug the nutrient cartridges in your d printer cooks for you based on inputs from nanobots floating in your bloodstream which monitor the nutrients you need most your d printer is furthermore configured to follow your preferences in this case to follow a paleo diet because you decided to be in line with evolution the animal protein supply is a mix of artificially grown meat fish worms and insect proteins the food quantity is also higher than usual because your printer anticipates your sport activity planned in your agenda indeed you gave access to your agenda to your printer the recipe is a new creation because you ve configured your printer to never print two times the same meal life is too short and the world s diversity of cooking too great to eat two times the same meal when you arrive at the harbor safety procedures are quick and simple just to give your stem cell box which could be used by the first aid kit on the boat the boat is small and no oxygen bottles are taken on board instead the trainer takes a suitcase containing syringes just before going into the water the trainer gives a shot to all participants what is in the shot mechanical artificial red cells providing a hours in vivo self contained underwater breathing apparatus scuba you and your friends dive in the water play and communicate with dolphins thanks to the dolphin speaker interfaced with your augmented reality diving mask suddenly the boat radar displays an alert on your mask shark approaching at high speed no time to swim back to the boat fight is the only option but you use your biological brain and think that there must be another way you remember that dolphins can sometimes fight a shark you turn to the dolphins hastily set your dolphin speaker to beam a help signal along with the d shape of a shark you quickly downloaded fortunately the dolphins understand your message they do thank you but get scared and swim away the ai advice was wise you feel frustrated that ai was once again smarter than you out of sea mist the shape of a shark is coming some last minute information is displayed on how to fight a shark to you and your friends you start to read them but too late the shark has chosen to attack you you see the shark s jaw dramatically expanding and nothing you loose consciousness you wake up on the boat fully recovered akemi is looking at you you ask her what happened she explains that your friends managed to scare the shark by fighting him from multiple sides on its gills and that he finally released you you ask but how come was i not wounded akemi you actually almost died your nano health bots detected your right kidney and your liver were critically failing the message was transmitted to the first aid kit on the boat and the d organ printer started to differentiate your stem cells and printed at fast speed two new organs i contacted a japanese surgeon expert in organ transfers for an urgent tele operation i gave him distant access to the first aid robotic surgery apparatus and he could work with the printed organs i hope you don t mind we chose a human surgeon we are still not confident enough with the cheaper fully robotic ai surgery your health insurance reckon that the incident could not have been avoided and financially covers the whole operation the file is already closed you ask what about the shark akemi continues since it drunk on your blood it will be infected by artificial viruses i guess you feel resented but you know that global eco regulations forbid to reprogram them at a distance to kill the shark however thanks to this artificial virus infection the shark is now trackable and should not create any further incident to any diver with an augmented reality diving mask as you put back your augmented reality lenses you look at your information feed and see that you have been thanked by diving surfing and fishing associations for successfully tracking an additional shark on the way back to the coast you skim some news and learn that a bomb has exploded at the headquarters of the association for biological human rights the police has found out that the bomb was printed directly through the local d printer of the association the cyber attack left traces distributed around the globe police said the identity of the hacker is uncertain and the debate rages whether it was triggered by a human or a coalition of artificial agents at the end of the day you realize that ai agents have done much for you today and are in awe and grateful to them and your friends you owe them all your life

0,how to create a artificial life ok hypothetically what if to create a sustainable organic civilization the creators have realized anything created in artificial environment will always tend towards entropy instead of cohesion so to create life you have to start with randoms and let it play out what if we are approaching artificial intelligence all wrong we are trying to base it off what we know and how we know heuristics but instead of trying to create artificial intelligence should we try to create a platform where such intelligence can develop on its own should we be creating a sandbox a vast vast vast sandbox like an entire universe and let things molecules bump around and with certain rules physics so that they clump and form stars and planets and maybe then just then life emerges organically and within that intelligence self emerges humanity to us such process is a long and hard way around it but if i were a super galactic th dimensional being intent on creating life that s how i would do it instead of trying to piece things together to make self conscious beings so in theory could we do the same thing with artificial intelligence with enough computing power can we simulate our own virtual universe with our set of things knowledge with our set of rules i e humanity and just let it play out for a very long time until something self emerges
0,i m tired of these depressed posts about unemployment maybe i m crazy but i don t think it s going to be much of a long term problem when the robots come for our jobs i keep reading these posts that say self driving cars are going to kill truckers jobs and all robots are going to get rid of nurses and teachers and this and this and this then we re screwed and only the robot inventers and owners will own anything and live like kings in gated communities then the rest of us will live in slums and if you try to do anything about it you ll get shot by drone soldiers and the only way to prevent this is a mass political movement now it s fucking stupid if truckers and nurses and so on lose their jobs over the course of or years and the us official unemployment rate goes over overnight you dont need a mass political movement years earlier you will have one right then you aren t going to convince a high percentage of the country that the solution is to pass a bunch of laws allowing soldier bots to pin everybody up in slums because the rich feel threatened at that moment sure republicans might win an election or two on the crazy idea that the solution is to repeal the minimum wage and get rid of taxes on rich people and that would suck but when those things dont give anybody a job there will be another election poof ubi is a major issue poof higher education is free etc etc etc it s going to suck if you are a truck driver at the start of this conversation for several years it s going to suck and you re going to be depressed and angry but you re not going to get shot by a soldier drone the whole idea that the rich are going to replace all labor with capital and then just exterminate the is ridiculous it s unrealistic things just aren t hard enough yet on the bottom for socialism to make a comeback if the rich start to literally fear violent poor people in large numbers if that s a real thing they have to worry about at some point you will see political change to placate the poor or to make them less poor anyway i m done ranting maybe i m crazy

0,instead of producing brand new electric buses why aren t we converting diesel buses into evs serious question and discussion we have companies doing ev conversions we have lightweight solid state batteries and with fleets you can scale the process effectively we have all the tools we need for me the problem is that producing million new electric vehicles teslas vws toyotas buses etc is not a sustainable way for making the ev transition particularly when we already have billion gas vehicles and we have the knowledge and resources to convert gas vehicles into electric evidence new electric is a company based in amsterdam where their business model is converting gas vehicles into evs they specifically offer vehicle fleet conversions if you do some quick research you ll find plenty of other companies and independent mechanics doing similar services companies like quantumscape and enovate are producing solid state batteries for production in the words of jeremy grantham a billionaire donating of his wealth to fighting climate change gt years into quantumscape we have just delivered a solid state battery of passenger vehicle capability to a leading global automobile firm vw who has put in million dollars gt this thing does not burst into flames it weighs half the weight so a tesla with pounds of battery would drop pounds drops pounds of dead weight it occupies half the volume practically a category killer on its own you can imagine what that means twice the power to weight ratio charges rapidly and has almost no danger associated with it gt it will also be the best green driven story and it will be the answer to several of my dreams of course the conversion process becomes much cheaper faster and more scalable when you are working with identical vehicle models like bus fleets because the process and parts are identical and this strategy can work for passenger vehicles as well see the electrification tab for a proposal you just need to work with a higher volume of similar model types to reach comparable scalability like you have in corporate repair centers so is there any reason why we shouldn t be starting initiatives around electrification p s u jaredpolis you guys should start seriously looking into this

0,how the flow of traffic would work with personal flying vehicles in my opinion i don t think this is the subreddit to post it in but screw it we ve all seen those flying machines in futurama and i can t wait when if they become reality i imagine they would be ai controlled since it is too dangerous to rely on human reactions at these speeds with many other vehicles around you lets assume these things travel upwards of mph in the sky i imagine invisable lanes but visable on holographic windshield projections an elevation view side view would look like this the computer could decrease the elevation of the vehicle the more it decelerates that way high speed travelers will not collide with lower speeds in the picture you can only see two planes of travel but there should really be about speed zones the interstate state traffic mph and local traffic mph this setup would solve the problem of being unable to quickly decelerate in the air without stalling etc idk i m just a stupid kid with a stupid idea just needed to post this to know someone saw it

0,technology vs climate how to fight climate change my biggest concern about the future is climate change although we have all of these great technologies which are improving quality of life health etc there is the stark reality of increasing global temperatures and climate disruption it seems to me that much of the future of humanity will depend on mitigating climate disruption and possibly even reversing the trend it seems quite possible that the temperature could increase by deg celsius by although i am and only have a business degree i would go back to school if it were possible for me to make a substantial contribution to the fight against this problem some ideas i had were going for nuclear engineering environmental engineering or something related or else maybe creating a public campaign to fight against fossil fuels somehow i would really like more information on the best possible way for me to make a substantial change if possible any ideas

0,an island nation of redditors hello all if you are interested in joining a hopefully newly formed island nation then this is the place to be the subbreddit is reddit com r theredditnation i have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task more detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request obviously the first question is where we would have our island i have identified places of interest one place of interest is the nation of belize belize is a small nation with a low gdp of billion and they are selling off most of their island islands with acres can be acquired for around give or take from the people government officials i have contacted they are perfectly okay with this plan now here is a step proposal of how this will come to fruition i will expand on how we will finance this acquire the island set up the initial infrastructure form of government that i propose is a constitutional monarchy for now i will be the king country will be run as a democracy two chamber form of parliament noble titles such as duke earl count lord baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island establishment of the government building for now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved people will be made citizens at this location establishment of civil services waste collection police social services establishment of a port this will allow supplies to enter the island this will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically i will expand on this later the port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed establishment of resident housing this temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up resident housing and the government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island a partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up make the island a desirable location set up the island as a luxury city free housing for citizens free healthcare for citizens free schooling and university for citizens build resorts and legalize gambling on the island the revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island with the revenue generated from this the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city the gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well make the island a banking haven set up a bank on the island no kyc laws will be enforced on the island this will attract forgien investment into the island allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy no income tax sales tax capital gains tax or corporate on the island commercial businesses such as casinos resorts and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes this will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island expand on the island infrastructure build an airport the islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets build more free luxury housing for residents establish schools and universities establish libraries establish museums establish a healthcare system enjoy the luxury haven of an island that we have built now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding according to my calculations you can look at them below it will cost us the island itself the port to build this will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments for passenger ferry we will budget around for operating costs initial buildings these buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment buildings include civil services around to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies another to purchase atvs another to purchase off roading vehicles bitcoin mining operation we will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company water purification food supply we will purchase mre s and other preserved food products for the island an exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan further development of the island this will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes now in regards to how we will raise that sum we will sell off noble titles this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy while no price has been established yet the titles for sale can include duke duchess marquess marchioness earl countess viscount viscountess baron baroness a small percentage of the island less than will be earmarked for sale immediately the part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won t have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws on a acre island acres would be marked for sale the acres on this haven of an island will be sold for each so the island would raise million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding once the island is set up the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation we will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this solar powered web hosting people can become citizens for a fee of which will mainly go to the printing of their id and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this if you have made it this far please join the subreddit more information to come soon thank you

0,someone please give me hope that the following is not our future i m being completely serious i m just giving a brief outline hopefully you can fill in the gaps with the obvious observe how most people are getting socially lost in the internet always having their noses stuck in their phones and related habitually dysfunctional behavior note the behavior of the people in charge of the world to farm the general population for labor as well as induce psychological addiction on multiple levels for example virtual economies are exist that do nothing more than foster and farm psychological addiction think of zinga games or what they used to be at any rate i m no longer following them just think pay to play virtual reality is just around the corner even if we weren t running out of physical resources the elites given their limited psychological space and own addictions will never share the physical wealth vr technology is therefor going to be used to trap the majority of people in virtual zinga like economies psychologically the people in these economies will believe that they have wealth to spend but this wealth will be ostensible this ostensible virtual wealth is going to be transferred to the elite through any number of psychologically based economic mechanisms of a complexity too difficult for most people i e the farmed billions to criticize that is we will be buying virtual goods using virtual goods the elite will then convert this virtual wealth to physical wealth that is they will convert their virtual wealth accumulation into control of the majority of physical wealth which few people will be able to afford in conclusion the future is going to be little more than a psychological information trap for the majority of people but it s going to be ostensibly presented as an information economy also we have no desire to modify the existing human psychological space ignorant apes have no desire to get away from their cars and other pathetic toys we will never modify our stone age intelligence because the elite psychological space itself precludes the possibility of the desire to self modify this is our future

0,ai why do we assume super intelligence this has been something i ve just been thinking about today i am very aware of what experts respected people are saying about the risks of ai and i do agree with them fully we need to be extremely careful with is as we really do not know how it will behave or react granted the benifits will be huge but a super intelligence escaping into the internet crippling the world economy skynet etc all nasty stuff however this assume one thing that it will actually be intelligent the human brain is essentially a very very complex wet computer with a way of operating we do not fully understand it is a neural network which doesn t operate the same way silicon computers do so to emulate this with silicon requires a lot of processing power this is why ai is a while off yet maybe yrs possibly longer i can t say anyway what is to say at the point we reach a singularity and it finally becomes conscious of what it is like a person but with an electronic brain what is to say that it won t be stupid or of low intellegence like a child granted it can interface with other electronics which is a huge advantage but again so can we to some extend we have developed devices in which we use to do this ie keyboard and mouse programs etc what is to say this ai will be no more intelligent than a normal person i know it will likely be able to run calculations much faster than a human person but that is assuming it operates like a computer does today we may have to profoundly change architecture and function in order to achieve ai this is just a thought really what are your opinions

0,is human nature inescapable as we venture out into space i ve been reading and watching the expanse series of books and tv shows recently and i ve found it quite thought provoking in its subject matter and setting i m sure many of you have some clue as to the nature of the verse but to summarize gt it is the year and humanity has extensively colonized the inner solar system and the jovian asteroid belt but it is as fragmented as ever earth now a single federation under the united nations that also governs protectorates in the belt colonies is embroiled in a cold war with the martian congressional republic a state that broke away from earth s authority at the same time the belters increasingly growing discontent with the un s authority is actively trying to create an independent nation of their own i think the setting illustrates well how human nature is inescapable in that we always try to find what sets us apart from others the belters being essentially a subspecies of humans distinct from earth and martian humans and using those differences as a justification for conflict of course the expanse is fictional but do you think that if we ever get this far as a species we ll end up in a very similar situation with conflict between humans over petty differences none of us can control or could we adopt the better angels of our nature and progress together as a united species
0,full potential humans control their own brain guys this is my first post i ve had this idea of having a sort of electronic regulator in the brain that would control hormone levels or neural chemicals that indirectly affect things like creativity critical thinking cognitive processing diligence sleep pattern etc etc you get the gist here s my no edit wordpad typed idea in the near future we would be able to tap a electrical processor near the corpus collosum of the brain that will regulate hormonal levels for optimal purposes as intended by the installer men and women dynamic sentient beings that have irregular swings in mood mindsets habits tendencies of procrastination in the future these regulators indirectly control human behavior it does not turn them into zombies they are conscious of their own thought and that they are aware that these regulators are affecting their behavior however to some extent they wanted to let these regulators manage their levels of hormones and neural chemicals that are accordingly attributed to things like diligence sleep pattern focus and attributes that would benefit creative and critical thinking adjectives that describe intellectual ability work ethic and others would soon vanish as such that all if not most people would be able to achieve the full sense of their talents without the restrictions of random or environmentally genetically affected processes in the brain issues in ethics about the product would be squandered pagans and heathens against this tapping of the neural potential should be left in the dust as these men and women whom have chosen to live in control of their own body of their own will with the help of technological advances it is essentially the advent of a new age where men and women of all ages races religious would finally reach the full potential that they so deserve psychiatry and psychology would remain stagnant as these all people find little to no problem with their psyche edit thanks you guys for all the wonderful responses i got this was just one of those times when i thought i made something sinister or thought of awesome comments d

0,how can steel be mass produced without utilising coal coke as a means of energy and alloy carbon hello askreddit linked is a news article on a situation in the uk that has been floating around for a while bbc news climate change six questions about the cumbria coal controversy the situation is that this new coal mine has been approved by the local authority responsible for the area the mine is being justified as being a local source of coal for coking towards supplying the steel industry which still barely exists in the uk and reduce reliance on imports this seems like a strategic decision and it makes sense for an island nation to have a level of self sufficiency opponents are screaming that this is counter to carbon reduction targets and other environmental commitments i can see the logic of this position although it seems a bit petty the coal coke is being burnt anyway surely local sourcing and new plants will be more environmentally friendly than the bulk shipping across the globe the question comes from a comment in the arrival uk steel has committed to clean energy tech by but the mine is licensed until what tech supplants the coal the origins of steel production were included in my studies way back with the bessemer process which uses a mix of iron ore coal and limestone burnt through an air blast vessel i don t know the particular advances seems converting the coal to come is one which makes sense as it is a refined product i am aware that aluminium uses raw electricity to smelt the ore it is very energy intensive and developed due to their being no practical alternatives is this possible for steel but steel needs carbon adding to the molten iron as it s an alloy what is the source for that carbon if not coke will charcoal work at the start of the iron industry charcoal was the energy source of choice for the furnaces

0,the good neighbor association fellow internet strangers i hope you and your family are all safe and in good health we are definitely living in very unique times and it will be interesting to read future history books that we will all be a part of if you happen to have some free time during this quarantine i was hoping you would give me some constructive criticism on a business plan i have been working on it s something i have been working on for a while now and i think i am finally nearing the end of the drafting phase i even have a lot of the principles and processes actively working now it might be easiest to start with the what for now and if that seems interesting enough then i can share the remainder of the plan and tools on a related note i need help answering questions about setting up a non profit i really don t know what sub this belongs in most but thanks in advance for reading through the good neighbor association elevator pitch the good neighbor association gna is a nonprofit property management company that focuses on the community and being a good neighbor over profits the basic principles of the good neighbor association is to lead by example to do things the right and economical way and be the change we all agree needs to happen the broad plan can be broken down into three primary functions first i want to provide an education path to teach my own tenants how to be good neighbors and give them employment opportunities through that process second i want to leverage those tenants to accomplish as many of the needs of the surrounding neighbors as possible including the process of buying their property when the time comes third i want to tie the whole process together in an extremely detailed and transparent lending portfolio that lets me and investors remove the banks as middle men and keep the profits in our communities instead of going to the ceo s already getting paid tens of millions what the good neighbor association is like a university that teaches the basics to living as a responsible mindful neighbor tuition and housing are rolled into one payment that includes the management budget to cover the cost of managing a personal residence effectively through the coursework of maintaining their own property managing residents will learn all the skills necessary to be a professional property manager they will gain ownership of the individual residence in the same manner someone gains ownership of a home through traditional amortized accounting while also building a savings budget for repairs and maintenance the more effectively they manage the place they are living the more value they will get in return when it is time to move out those that enjoy the work involved with property management will also have access to consistent work provided by the university with pay starting at hr and going as high as hr the end hope is to help all the students create their own businesses that allow them to charge what they feel they are worth while also doing something that is personally fulfilling even if that work is unrelated to property management the skills gained are transferable to nearly anything else one could imagine the good neighbor association is a beacon of community support that ensures no one is living below a minimum standard of human decency the gna will leverage the students from the university to provide cost effective support for residents who are beginning to age out of the ability to keep their homes in minimum shape additionally there is a program that allows residents to exchange their equity in the home to cover some of the ongoing cost to maintain their residence the program will allow the homeowner and the gna to split the profits that would normally go to a bank to accomplish the same process as home equity lines of credit but also provide the actual process of how to effectively use that money to maintain the home effectively the system lets the homeowner use property value appreciation instead of paying interest directly at the end of the process there is a built in process that helps the resident move and manage the sale of the property for the maximum value including removing the normal realtor fees and closing costs associated with the traditional home sale process the good neighbor association is a transparent investment platform that allows anyone to invest in the humans and communities around us there are investment options ranging from one year to thirty years and the returns are competitive to the other traditional investing options investors will be able to see exactly what their money is spent on in as much detail as they care to dive into there will be a web portfolio for each investment that will record and tell the unique story of each individual residence investors will be able to support the education and training of productive good neighbors all while beautifying the communities they live in

0,a list of possibly surprising things we need before humanity can evolve a universal organizational function kinda like a language combined with math basically we need a way of sorting any given thing into categories that are connected so that we can figure out what one thing is in relation to all the other things this way we stop duplicating stuff and can more easily understand what things are pretty much like a brain neural network i guess i presume it will be like pascal s triangle with things branching as sets are separated into two different subsets and then recombining previously uncombined but similar subsets to form new sets a meme that gives humanity a positive purpose in life i mean i have a sort of amalgamation of this the general purpose of reality is to try all possible patterns of matter and energy so that there are no holes in reality and life more specifically has a purpose of creating exploring and sharing new things that benefit life as a whole but it needs to be simplified and shared so that it can become entrenched in culture and understandable by every human possible every individual needs to know that they are valuable to the universe regardless of who they are or what they think and do and they need to know that they can trust their goals for doing cool stuff in life even when others try to pressure them to feel crappy about themselves and their dreams free access to the internet and the tools to make use of it for all humans possible and other earthlings as well so that information can be easily found and used whenever needed major simplification of educational offerings to be generalized clear and concise rather than wasting decades of human life with fairly confusing boring and even useless information in mostly arbitrary order the universal categorization math language mentioned up there will help with this but even without it we can do so much better we don t need to teach details for the most part those can be discovered when needed for a very specific project or research to become an expert in some field every field or problem that we want to offer educational materials about should start with super basic structural commonalities if there are exceptions then you re not doing your generalities well enough and that needs to be fixed only when individuals are fully comprehending the general ideas will they need to move onto more detailed sub topics and only if they are interested or have a problem they personally want to solve that the general ideas don t help with and educational materials need to be developed by peer collaboration with artists scientists educators and students all working together not by one individual or type of group

0,streamlined manufacturing vs individual craftsmanship i was discussing jacque fresco s future by design with my girlfriend last night and i had brought up the point of manufacturing jobs and our current societal viewpoint that people should be creating our products and that soon it would be entirely unnecessary as well as inefficient for people to be doing jobs machines could easily do it is my belief that human beings are best suited creating as what differentiates us from other beings in nature is our consciousness and imagination i had begun to think about craftsmanship the creation of hand made tables clothes watches and things of that nature i had thought about how the quality and artistic value of said objects when crafted by true professionals and masters is often greater and appreciated more than streamlined objects so my question then is how do we distinguish what is better left to masters of crafts to create through inspiration or to machines to build through protocol

0,a thought about full dive virtual worlds waifus and fidelity this just crossed my mind i m unfortunately debatably not concerned by it since i ve been single for the last years but i still think this is an interesting subject to talk about and i d love to hear what this sub think of it so there are lots of games in which you have the option to romance npcs and being in love within a great monogamous relationship has never been a reason to not explore and enjoy these kind of sidequests no one in their right mind would call it cheating nor would get jaelous over a fictionnal character just because their lover s avatar gets intimate with a hottie but what about fulldive vr games just imagine your beloved so coming back from a hard day s work they give you a loving smile and a kiss and after some small talk instead of turning on their ps they turn on their full dive device they bought this awesome full dive remake a few days ago and you talked about it a little looks like gpt is doing an amazing job at creating believable and meaningfull conversations with npcs and you heard enough to know that they re about to get freaky with tali zorah and it s going to be steamy they re gonna feel everything how would you feel about this situation this is just a game these characters don t exist they re not even sentient ais your so is just playing a game right well to be honest i was indeed a little bit jaelous watching my ex girlfriend playing through mass effect and being intimate with jacob as jane shepard and she was playfully teasing me about it but overall it was just a funny moment but if she had been in fulldive i probably would ve joined in and smashed jacob s head to a pulp before he could lay a finger on her would you consider it over reacting what would you do how would you react does this mean fulldive devs will try to avoid it outside of porn fulldive should they what about when it evolves into romancing sentient agis will this change how humanity thinks of relationships i might be a little pessimistic here but i have lost faith in finding love ever again having been alone for such a long time has a tendency to make you think this way so i m pretty hyped for some fulldive love with a sentient agi as it seems to be my only escape from romantic loneliness but i can t help to wonder what it s gonna be like for those who still have a romantic life what do think about all this

0,whoever reaches singularity or kardashev i will probably monopolize the world s power immediately in a series of posts i explained that most of the world s progresses concentrated in a few advanced countries won t be enjoyed by most of the world s population who are just scraping by which itself will get harder thanks to ai catching up democracy egalitarianism etc are becoming more irrelevant as tech advances and those who are in the position to use them get much more ahead from the rest of humanity it is likely that only a few percent of population even in the advanced countries will be in the position to benefit from the new tech which means they are probably likely to monopolize its benefits even a cursory thought makes it clear that not too many people can enjoy the benefits of the super tech let s imagine everyone has nukes and can use them whenever he or she or it feels like that what will happen to the world or let s assume d printers get cheaper and more people have access to them and things get a bit more advanced so everyone can make the things they wish with them the world s economy will  it is like giving everyone the ring of sauron frodo the fool gave it up with gandalf s sweet talking but not everyone will be like him it is unavoidable that those who reach kardashev type i or singularity first will quickly monopolize the world s power just like the americans who quickly monopolized the world s power with the a bomb on some people like the rosenbergs gave the tech to ussr so usa would not be the only country which has the bomb but the soviet bomb was greatly inferior to the american one for most of the early s given that singularity or ki would require a heavier investment and a greater scale than a nuke which even north korea can make now as i have written in a few previous posts it is very unlikely that a nation group whatever after singularity or ki is achieved will be able to quickly follow the example overnight of course that means the immediate death of democracy freedom etc and all that since almost everything is no longer relevant after these goals are reached and those who did it have entered a new stage of civilization existence whatever you can name it it is say like an australopithecus learning how to walk in feet the leap is comparable to that there will be new problems after reaching these stages but that s something to be worried about when that takes place it suffices to say that whoever has reached them first is probably going to be remembered as gods by subsequent generation like prometheus the guy who discovered fire

0,the answer to technological unemployment is obvious if controversial the workers should own the means of production the d printing industry is advancing at an unimaginable pace and workers could run the machines from home workers could combine their production power virtually to make large products like electric cars a company could create a huge virtual factory with a decent sized final assembly plant workers could pick up the jobs they want to assign their machines to work on taking advantage of the unique capabilities each machine has so for example one machine in a network could just focus on printing photovoltaics and another could specialize in the use of metals it could become kind of like a high tech version of a cottage industry i know this may sound like communism and i guess in a way it shares some similarities but at the end of the day i think we re going to have to approach our problems with a non dogmatic open mind it seems that every day we re seeing new capabilities develop in the d printing field and what i would love to see is a sort of self replicating assembly network form i have this idea of a matter network or matnet for short where people kind of self organize online to tackle large projects eventually i would like to see this network extend to the entire solar system
0,how could i a graphic designer contribute to  i ve graduated from university and worked as a fulltime graphic designer for a bit over a year now i consider myself talented and became employed very easily i ve come to the realization that what i m doing is making me miserable as none of the art i make is for anything i am passionate about i used to enjoy graphics before it turned into my gig but there s so little emotional attachment to what i make i ve stopped caring about it i ve been very interested in  and cosmology for many years now and i would simply like to dedicate myself to something i take interest in rather than make graphics for the local dog celebrity or whatever it is my employer has me work on any certain day i lack knowledge for mathematics or physics but i want to contribute to the future in some way is there hope
0,what do you think will eventually replace streaming we re in that era where streaming is taking over traditional tv viewing back then the cable television was revolutionary and i am sure that people at the time were thinking this is the future but is there a technology at the present that could eventually replace streaming netflix hulu amazon prime youtube in terms of viewing entertainment
0,just because we will have access to better tech in the future doesn t mean life will be better just want everyone to keep this well in mind all throughout the s it was believed that technology was the key to having a better life all around this is what technological advancements from until now have cost us severe decline of brick and mortar retailers resulting in tens of millions of jobs lost severe decline of movie theaters and complete disappearance of movie rental industry resulting in tens of millions of jobs lost severe decline of mid size enterprises resulting in a monopoly or oligopoly driven economy in many first world countries competition is nearly impossible and the biggest companies have the power to drive smaller ones out of business by dropping costs of their merchandise at a loss to them just long enough to drive other competitors out of business obsession with automation ai process improvement has resulted in at least a hundred million jobs and will result in even more job losses as powerful oligopolies grow even stronger they have the capital to automate of their workforce and remove the need for most human labor thus removing the need for the working class globally self driving cars will result in at least million jobs lost in transportation insurance self driving cars rarely get in accidents healthcare less people getting in car accidents delivery driving what will the world look like in the future i honestly can t even imagine i literally can t fathom what the world is going to be like in years once we have automated everything hundreds of millions of jobs there is little to no reason for humans to even have jobs anymore and the wealthy own of all wealth globally we are either all going to be incredibly extremely miserably poor with no choice in the matter or we will simply cease to exist over the next century because we cannot possibly compete with monstrous megalith corporations and the working class will simply die out so the few wealthy elite of the world can have the entire planet earth themselves
0,prediction automation will have a negative effect on education while education is important to society one of the reasons in the last years education grew so rapidly and accessible to all is that labor and certain professions needed an educated work force with automation becoming more and more widespread going to college for many professions will no longer be economically viable due to the cost of the education and also the amount of jobs available an example is one day lawyers might be automated and run by ai many will choose other professions rather than study law for many years and pay huge tuition bills in addition if a basic income comes into play due to automation this could be a one two punch to education since many people might choose not to go to college or university at all since they chose to go to school mainly to make them more marketable in the work force and yes education at the university level might be free one day maybe it is free today to some extent but most people only choose to make a committment to school if it gives them a good return on investment while i do think people are inherently good and strive to be the best i don t think most people will pursue an education after the basics age if it doesn t provide them with a monetary reward or status i just wanted to start a discussion and hear other people s viewpoints and ideas on this subject thanks
0,should we eradicate bats bats are a very prolific vector of disease most famously rabies as well as ebola and many others likely including coronavirus i know a bunch of people are going to jump out and point out all the destructive insects that bats eat but is that really worth it covid has killed thousands and put billions out of work one study found that bats save north american farmers billion per year by eating pests but that pales in comparison to the trillions of dollars that the pandemic is costing the economies of the us and canada so maybe it s time to start hunting

0,question how viable are orbital solar arrays quite a simple question and i m doing some research of my own but you guys here seem quite well versed in this sort of thing already how viable an option for providing large volumes of power are orbital solar arrays that collect store and beam energy down to earth is the technology for this here already in its infancy or merely conceptual pipe dreams could an energy storage option contained on such an array allow us to smooth out high demand periods with as needed availability this is prompted by the discussion that stemmed from the post about modular nuclear reactors wherein people raised the point about solar that some areas simply don t have a high enough level of insolation for solar to be a viable industrial energy source i also ask because as blue origin have announced their new glen launcher and spacex have discussed the falcon heavy and ist launch system in recent days it seems like payload capacity for such a project is finally just around the corner this isn t about cost or political will power though i d be interested to hear any cost estimates merely if we can do this today or in the near future

0,reincarnation in virtual reality i think it d be cool af to live loads of different lives in virtual reality while temporarily erasing your memories so you wouldn t be aware you re in virtual reality but would it even be possible to simulate the entire world or temporarily erase your memories while you live in virtual reality and grow from a baby maybe we could slow our perception of time down too so we don t miss much in the real world so i can live for years in virtual reality while only month has passed in real life i d only wanna do it if i was completely unaware i was in virtual reality and i could grow from a baby and live exactly like im doing right now except i d have control over what kind of life i have before i actually start it another thing that crossed my mind is licensing rights etc like if you wanted to simulate the s and live in that era how would we create it so we have the same movies tv shows celebrities people etc from that time period or would that just be impossible
0,a name for this power i m trying to think of the words to describe a concept around remotely powering electronics wirelessly and with coded power sending only a targeted devise the signal to be powered from it is a robotics falling into a category between animate blobs that spawn by being wholely divided and the androids with wires as much as blood vessels in man a central processing unit for a brain there in the category between is the robot with semi and autonomous parts they process some signals for commands autonomously they receive power independently and from a readily available source that is nonconstraining and possibly of a minimal burden androgynous traits are in our mathematical concept of counting the natural numbers are the single expansion of singleness much like the self of others is the expansion of the self of one s own the future robot however may well transcend this singleness of the unit much as it appears to be doing in actual technology with computers and phones connected by the internet it is possible the meaning of self and identity can be fractured by the manifestation of this multiplicity in the units of devices
0,what role should hybrid diesel electric semi trucks play in a transition to a green and sustainable energy grid i looked at the wikipedia page for hybrid semi trucks and it appears there has been little progress on the concept since the last decade a better design for freight trucks would be a diesel electric hybrid design where the combustion engine runs at a constant speed maintaining a battery pack and driving an electric motor most of the time the motor runs off the generator engine but going uphill or accelerating from stops it would draw from the battery

0,technological progress is slowing down peter thiel i ve been a fan of peter thiel for a while now i read his book zero to one listened to him talk on various podcasts and generally follow what he does he s a really interesting guy i mean the dude is a gay billionaire republican libertarian from germany who made his billions in silicon valley he invented paypal with elon musk and he s a trump supporter wtf right he s also responsible for shutting down gawker gawker outed him as gay a long time back by funding hulk hogan s lawsuit against them there s a lot of weird interesting and apparently self contradicting things about the guy one of the things i ve heard him say that s striking is that technological progress has slowed down specifically he talks about how our ability to create new physical things like flying cars and exotic materials has way declined he says that this is a huge problem for us because we need growth in order to survive economic growth requires technological advancement hence a giant looming problem for our future but is that true this does seem to be a point of contention for many inventors and entrepreneurs take something like moore s law which refers to the fact that cpus double in power about every months many people acknowledge that moore s law cannot continue indefinitely the latest cpus socs already use a six nanometer manufacturing process people like bill joy have said that we only have something like years left until the laws of physics prevent moore s law from continuing he said this at a conference about years ago physics won t allow us to go much smaller than six nanometers the counterargument that ray kurzweil has put forward is that yes it is true that physics will prevent moore s law from continuing using the current cpu paradigm he cites for instance the fact that our earliest computers were mechanical essentially giant abacuses then it was discovered that the job could be better done with vacuum tubes then it was discovered that the job could be better done with solid state semi conducting silicon transistors ray suggests the silicon transistor paradigm will be milked for what it s worth until a new paradigm is invented perhaps some kind of massively parallel dna based computer a new quantum computer model or using the current design but stacking cpus on top of one another in order to keep moore s law in action i think ray is right we will somehow or another find a way to keep moore s law true as for the lack of technological progress for manufacturing physical things peter has a good point but i suspect that the lack of progress in creating new materials and physical things is a sort of illusion it turns out that everything is an information process for this reason i think that provided that moore s law continues for another years we will eventually have unbelievably powerful computers we will in turn use those unbelievably powerful computers to create new materials and physical products that will be truly surprising and un intuitive materials and products that have unusual optical properties like invisibility materials that are vastly stronger and more lightweight such that they float in the air and are yet much stronger than steel materials that conduct electricity without loss of energy as heat batteries with a higher energy density than gasoline the lack of technological progress i d argue is an illusion the technologies undergirding our world are making continual incrementing progress every advancement of the underlying technologies goes unnoticed until a critical threshold is met and then bam a giant killer app is invented changing the world forever apparently from out of nowhere that s what youtube iphones and oculus rifts are it s not as if someone suddenly had the idea to provide a streaming video service for free or to create a tiny touchscreen tablet with cellular modems or to create virtual reality headsets it s that the underlying tech kept improving until these things became feasible people realized that the time was finally right to begin manufacturing these ideas what happened with youtube iphones and oculus rifts will eventually happen with all physical products as moore s law continues and as we develop the ability to very quickly and accurately model physical systems with our computers impossible mind blowing physical products will eventually emerge we just need a bit more time and a few more cycles of moore s law the nature of reality is that it manifests from the inside out there has to first be an information template that s what invention and innovation are products begin as simulations in the mind of the inventor human bodies begin in the information content of the zygote we use the information processing capabilities of our computers to manufacture and invent new products as moore s law continues whether with the current paradigm of semi conductors or with a completely different and new paradigm new impossible world changing materials and physical products will eventually emerge and it will appear as though they came out of nowhere

0,an open letter to manufacturers proponents and opponents of automated vehicles let me start off by saying i am fascinated by the growth in technology in the past ten years as a society we have reached a tipping point where we can have autonomous vehicles of all distinctions but should we jobs will be lost for every programming retrofitting and service job created a professional driver will be eliminated from the work force this will happen i am warning all of those who hold drive for a living you are going to lose your jobs the financial incentives are just too powerful for these businesses to pass up once they have proven themselves i m telling you this now in the hopes that you will take this time to transition into another job jobs on the chopping block include cdl truckers taxis both gypsy and professional pizza delivery drivers and a number of related fields add to that collision centers parking structures municipalities due to a sharp you might say cliff like reduction in moving violations and even car thieves so with all of this doom and gloom why does the industry seem hell bent on giving us this kind of a burden it is simple autonomous vehicles avs will revolutionize our world everyone imagines riding to work in comfort while watching the end of your favorite show or napping in the passenger seat while your miracle whisks you toward your destination let me give you a few you may not have thought of that can be as well received parking you live in a large city where parking spaces are such a hassle to find that you end up leaving forty five minutes or more earlier just to get where you need to be on time won t it be amazing when you can pick up your phone and say go find a spot to park and i ll call you back when i need you your car then travels five blocks away and finds a nice spot and then sits there waiting for you it found this spot because one of its fellow cars just broadcast the fact that it was leaving and the location of where it was to the closest vehicle your meeting is wrapping up so you call your car back it reaches out to the internet and other cars then utilizes its own telemetry to calculate how long it will take to return and then sends you that message you step out the door and your car is waiting for you cool in summer or warm in winter ride sharing you are at work for eight hours a day wouldn t it be nice if your car could as well imagine pulling into work and sending your car on its way in ride share mode an organizing entity keys in on your car and dispatches pick up points the car does its job and funds are deposited into your account i personally wouldn t want some sweaty man with an aversion to deodorant sitting in my car but you may want the money more than i do greatly reduced insurance autonomous vehicles should lower fatalities by but what about non fatal accidents what about theft and vandalism what about hit and run accidents autonomous vehicles will have complicated sensor arrays around the vehicle in a short amount of time these will include full uhd cameras on all four corners of the vehicle they will be recording and then recording over that data after a certain amount of time when some kid comes at the car with slim jim the car can send the relevant frames to the proper authorities the instant it recognizes an intrusion i ll go one better due to the wide variety of sensors around the car you will be able to get a height and approximate weight for the perpetrator with the inter vehicle communications ability you ll be able to tag and capture several images of any sort of incident instantly all of this means fewer payouts for insurance companies which leads to remarkably lower premiums this is already the case for anti theft systems airbags and other safety systems in newer vehicles i ve talked a lot about this inter vehicular communications system but what am i talking about i m talking about a military level encrypted wireless signal that creates an adhoc network between groups of cars and back to the internet beyond wifi but on the same general idea fully autonomous vehicles join the interstate among the dumb cars the avs recognize these vehicles as vehicles by using lidar sonar and or visual processing but when they send out a whois signal and receive nothing back they treat that vehicle as an unknown avs give those cars a wide berth because they have no idea what the person inside is going to do avs on the other hand will be able to sync up and share information on the highway they could be given free range based on road conditions traffic and hundreds of other permissive logic gates that if met will allow the vehicles to train imagine five different cars sharing information to maintain a one foot gap between each vehicle the middle car knows where the front car is going it knows how fast it is going and it knows what is in front of it as well highway speeds could safely be doubled under optimal conditions if a dumb car would happen to try and join the train the train would break apart to safe dumb car highway distances and speeds training would divide the air resistance between multiple cars or trucks essentially hypermiling any time they are on the highway imagine fully loaded semi trucks traveling down a deserted stretch of interstate at two o clock in the morning one foot from each other five deep at seventy or eighty miles per hour without a soul on board no rest periods no log books just a completely predictable schedule that can be monitored anywhere in the world another interesting feature could be priority while you drive you are constantly forced to make judgement calls when to let people go when to speed up and by how much when to slow down these judgements will be something autonomous vehicles have to make as well what if you could tell your car you want priority because you re late the car can t speed because that s against the law but it can firm up its shift points safely pull away from the stop line a bit quicker if there is open road etc what if it could go one further you tell your car you want priority and in turn your car tells others around it that it has a priority request any other vehicles on that route could give all judgement calls to your car shaving some time safely off your morning commute i know what you re thinking i ll just get in and say i want priority every day well no that obviously won t work but a banked system would on a day you re not in a rush you put the car in passive mode or comfort where the car might take a less congested route to your destination and give priorities more weight in judgement situations the when your bank is empty you are forced to use normal mode let s talk about other benefits of this carfi each car being linked together and sharing information based on expected routes will come with additional perks many avs will also likely be evs with some kind of regenerative braking system so a car stopped at a light will broadcast its telemetry including stopped time the vehicles will be able to slow down using only regenerative braking or just not accelerate into the stopped vehicles by slowing down where appropriate it will be able to time the lights and not have to come to a complete stop this will be good for wear items like brake pads not to mention a smoother ride and it will be good for both fossil fuel cars as well as evs it takes more energy regardless of how it is stored to return an object to motion vs remaining in motion another benefit will be hyper accurate traffic with all avs knowing where the slowdowns are occurring they can take an alternate route with less traffic they will also be able to offer up their databases to the ntsb in order to optimize traffic flow patterns and make everything smoother for avs and non avs alike mountains of data generated by these vehicles everyday will help city planners with construction projects it will help keep mapping software accurate and that will make the entire road system more efficient one of the first questions i get from opponents of this technology is what about when the hackers come and wreck a bunch of cars well first military level encryption we don t seem to worry about the drones too often and that is the type of system i m talking about secondly the cars and trucks will have multiple banks of sensors if the carfi becomes corrupted or gives data that conflicts with the other banks of sensors the car will be able to ignore that information all be it at a reduced speed and increased margin of error where it comes to distance if the vehicles become incapacitated for any length of time they could be told to pull over or insist on self drive from the licensed occupant if one is available all the while broadcasting a warning signal back to a central location if there are several signals in the same location the authorities will be contacted and sent the relevant data another feature would be should anything happen using the carfi network groups of vehicles could be patched as exploits are found the only downside is this network would need to be entirely secure without penetration so jail breaking your car would have to be impossible with that being the case though the software should immediately be standardized all avs talk to all other avs utilize the same sensor data and speak the same language to one another the system should be open to all vehicle manufacturers so that there is complete standardization across all platforms completely available for network security specialists and open to penetration testing with generous rewards if avs are to usher in the next hundred years of travel they need to be safe and secure one more aspect of the av platform is the vehicle should have access to all of the body sensors with a computer onboard the vehicle will be able to track how long it took the car to stop from when it applied the brakes and within a reasonable margin for error it will be able to alert you when it needs service but better than that it will be able to take itself in instant mpg calculations or mpc and with little effort the vehicle should be able to make some determinations about its own condition it will be able to monitor tire pressure sensors and vibration sensors to know when and where the trouble is coming from and it will be able to alert you if the vehicle passes an unsafe to operate threshold it will give you the option of insisting on service or parking until it can be serviced as in any relationship communication is the key i mentioned retrofitting dumb cars earlier so i ll dive a bit deeper into that many vehicles have the main components to be an av already installed electric steering many vehicles in the past few years have ditched the steering box or rack and pinion steering system for an electric motor if you can send an electric signal from the steering column to the front wheels and turn them you can do that using a computer the next component abs brakes abs or antilock braking system utilizes a pump to create pressure and alternated it between wheels with very little effort that system could provide even braking to stop an av third is fly by wire throttle like the other two systems fbw utilizes an electric signal to operate a servo that opens the butterfly on the intake and signals the computer to fire longer pulses on each injector we ve had cruise control on cars for decades and intelligent cruise control for years when you tie these three systems together with a large cpu and feed information from sensor pods mounted around the car you can see how dumb cars can become avs an entire aftermarket will spring up to accommodate this new market as for older vehicles and large trucks servos motors and pumps will be able to take over the important systems finally as all things change so must we age one of the worst things about growing old is losing your independence as we age our reaction time slows our vision weakens and we slowly become a danger to ourselves and others avs will give us our freedom and let us hold on to our dignity far into the future your car could take you to the doctor or pick you up from surgery it could even pick up your prescriptions while you finish with the doctor with only a few tweaks to drive through pharmacies in an emergency it could even take you to the hospital and signal ahead for help one major concern i have is this the vehicle will have to make a choice at some point of who lives and who dies in an event where a number of things has gone horribly wrong the vehicle has made all of the calculations and it must choose between hitting a building and probably killing the occupant or hitting kids walking across the street the car will be able to do the math faster than i can type this but in that event which path does it choose i don t have that answer and i hope someone far more intelligent than i will put some serious thought into it in summation yes people who drive for a living will need to find new work they will need to be retrained there are too many upsides to avs but you have some time to begin the retraining process i suggest hvac technician they pay well and are always in demand now for the leaders of this new technology i urge you to keep this vision standardization will be the only way forward differentiate yourselves based on amenities we are all counting on what you do next

0,a study measuring the rate of improvement in algorithms everyone has heard of moore s law but how much better are algorithms getting every year this is a subject that comes up a lot it s very relevant to the progress in ai people often claim that ai progress is just due to hardware progress and that algorithms are improving much slower and that if hardware progress ends many things will slow down it would certainly be interesting to know how quickly algorithms are improving is progress very slow or nonexistent or are things improving exponentially well the machine intelligence research institute did some research to find out algorithmic progress in six domains gt in recent boolean satisfiability sat competitions sat solver performance has increased per year depending on the type of problem however these gains have been driven by widely varying improvements on particular problems retrospective surveys of sat performance on problems chosen after the fact display significantly faster progress gt chess programs have improved by around elo points per year over the last four decades estimates for the significance of hardware improvements are very noisy but are consistent with hardware improvements being responsible for approximately half of progress progress has been smooth on the scale of years since the s except for the past five go programs have improved about one stone per year for the last three decades hardware doublings produce diminishing elo gains on a scale consistent with accounting for around half of progress gt improvements in a variety of physics simulations selected after the fact to exhibit performance increases due to software appear to be roughly half due to hardware progress gt the largest number factored to date has grown by about digits per year for the last two decades computing power increased fold over this period and it is unclear how much of the increase is due to hardware progress gt some mixed integer programming mip algorithms run on modern mip instances with modern hardware have roughly doubled in speed each year mip is an important optimization problem but one which has been called to attention after the fact due to performance improvements other optimization problems have had more inconsistent and harder to determine improvements gt various forms of machine learning have had steeply diminishing progress in percentage accuracy over recent decades some vision tasks have recently seen faster progress what happens when funding is exponential as well note that this is not about general software if you feel the computer programs you use every day are getting slower that s a totally different issue this is about algorithms in mainly scientific domains which use large amounts of computing power and are highly optimized for speed but surely you ve noticed that computer graphics seem to get more and more realistic every year voice recognition gets better and better these are the kinds of things that benefit from algorithmic progress as well as hardware improvements

0,how to allocate the resources to advance to a new civilization to the cognitive elites now the world is facing an advance never seen before but it has also hit a roadblock on advancing toward a type i civ there is a debate to allocate the resources according to each person s needs or to concentrate the resources to those who are the most likely to succeed the smartest the richest and those who are able to create the most advances whether you like or not there are billions of people who are not capable of understanding the future or participating in it in another post i wrote about introducing draconian policies to stop any activities which might hinder reaching another dimension of human civilization only about and i am giving the benefit of the doubt of the whole population are say designing things building machines and improving civilizations and they are making more money and directly or indirectly leaving more people behind not because the latter is bad but the latter simply lack the capacity to follow i think that it will be necessary for humanity to make a decision to either uplift everyone or to concentrate everything to the elites and simply kiss goodbye to those who can t join there or at least do not have any skills for them billions of people who do not belong in the future could live out in genteel poverty provided basic food shelter and sanitation somewhat like the japanese american internees during the world war ii although i pointed elsewhere that the ja men smarter than most chose to fight in europe rather than to stay there but not much else and plenty of entertainment to kill their time combined with elaborate methods to reduce their number in short they will be allowed to live like the animals rescued in shelters who are usually neutered on admission if they rebel it will be necessary to slaughter them without mercy militarized police will mow them down so the elites can continue their activities without any bother eventually with the less able gradually out of picture the world enters a new phase of civilization with kardashev type i singularity and all the goodies not imaginable now or the world could decide to allocate the resources to the less able whose numbers will eventually overwhelm the cognitive elites and create something like a pol pot shoot all the smarties rule which will bring the world to the level of say zimbabwe it is probably going to be one or another no middle ground such regression of civilization did happen a few times like the so called dark ages or the mayans who were more advanced during around than on

0,i have discovered a way to gain immortality in years and resurrect the dead in years using technology the theory of resurrection using technology in this post i will share with you a theory that will give humanity immortality within years and resurrect the dead within years those who dare not dream in the end are left with nothing a quote by me shir itzhak huber this theory will only happen if humanity manages to invent the technologies needed to make this theory a reality theory of immortality through resurrection this theory is based on a phenomena where people see outside their body during surgery which i believe is their souls leaving and re entering their body and how to use poison to make the soul of a dead person enter an artificial body effectively resurrecting him this theory assumes souls are very small particles that remain where a person died until resurrected and link with the afterlife when they run out of life force before being resurrected poisons in order to resurrect the dead we need to obtain poisons the first poison is a poison that i call soul removal poison the soul of any person who is effected by this poison will leave the person s body the second poison we need is a poison i call soul absorption poison any soulless body that is effected by this person will absorb a nearby dead persons soul effectively reviving him a how to create the poisons when a person goes through surgery sometimes he can see himself outside his body during the surgery what i believe is happening is that his soul a very small particle left his body during the surgery and he can remember what his soul saw when it was outside his body when his soul is returned to his body in order to create the soul removal poison we need to scan some patients brain during their surgeries and ask them if they had an out of body experience then we need to find the part of the brain that is normally working but stopped working during all of the surgeries where an out of body experience occurred then we need to create a poison that disables that part of the brain to create the soul absorption poison we merely need to restore function to the part of the brain the soul removal poison disables b what to do if the soul absorption poison doesn t work if the soul absorption poison doesn t work we need to find when an out of body experience ends in order to find when an out of body experience ends precisely there should be a change in brain activity from when the body is without a soul to when it has one and if we can find parts of the brain that are inactive before this change and are active after we can try and do resurrection trials with re activating each of them along with the part of the brain that is responsible for keeping our soul inside our body until we find the part that is responsible for soul absorption c if i am correct using the poisons together will cause the brain of an artificial body to absorb a dead man s soul instead of a babies soul resurrect rather then create a grown baby d the resurrection experiment in order to prove the dead can be resurrected we will need to perform the following experiment we put a stem cell body in a hospital whenever an organ donor that agrees to the experiment is undergoing low survival surgery a stem cell body will be put in the corner of the surgery room if the person dies the first organ to be removed will be the brain and it will be burned at the room to insure the person died in after the brain is burned the stem cell body will be injected with the soul absorption poison and something to disable the soul removal poison then we wait a few hours and see if the stem cell body gains consciousness if it does we monitor it for a year and see if he regains his the dead person s memories on his own if after a year he doesn t regain his memories or shows any sign of being an adult and not a baby we inject him with memory restoring medicine if there will be a cure for alzheimer s inject him with that and any other similar cure treat him as if he has alzheimer s if by the age of from being resurrected he doesn t regain his memories try and send him to a special school for the stem cell resurrected if he doesn t grow up like a normal kid by the age of can t talk for example from being resurrected then there is a defect in the stem cell body that is preventing him from regaining his memories and we need to improve the stem cell bodies before trying again e the experiment of resurrection will need to be carried out on thousands of volunteers at once each time to insure accuracy and speed up the resurrection why use stem cell bodies we need to ensure the body we resurrect the dead to will not have a soul of its own not when its created and not after stem cell body can be created with no souls if we poison the stem cell body with a soul removing poison before we finish printing it won t get its own soul then when we want to resurrect the dead we replace the soul removing poison with a soul absorbing poison causing the stem cell body to resurrect the nearest dead soul there may be more steps but that s the basics of it how to create the stem cell body we print an entire human body using stem cells to create everything from blood to organs to bones using a d printer resurrect long dead i believe if a person is dead for too long his soul won t be capable of being absorbed into a stem cell body can t be resurrected without restoring its energy we will need to figure out how the human brain charges the soul with energy i have a few guesses a emotions if this is the case if we can figure a way to transmit human emotions into the air hook a stimulated heart to a portable machine maybe b brain energy i have a theory that when the humans sleep their brain recharges their souls with life energy if we hook up a brain to a machine that can extract this energy into the air we can use it to recharge dead souls and resurrect the long dead into stem cell bodies the inventions necessary to make this theory a reality have not yet been invented and would likely be invented by someone other then me this theory is like a blueprint the four theories in it are the parts necessary to make it a reality the four parts are stem cell body soul removal poison soul absorption poison find out what energy our soul runs on and how to distribute it into the air into souls that where dead for more then a certain time only the first parts are necessary for immortality part number is necessary for resurrection and i predict it will take the longest to get amp

0,why i think it s foolish to assert that aliens exist i ve seen and heard plenty of people stating that aliens must exist and anyone that doesn t think aliens exist is an idiot people mostly assert that since there are billions upon billions of stars there must be a few where like earth life has began while i don t think it s sensible to rule out the existence of aliens i also think that it is foolish to assert that they exist at least as strongly as most people do today the main problem is our lack of data we have absolutely no idea how life on earth began yes there are some theories about it but the truth is that we have no idea about what it was that first caused life to begin for that reason we also have no idea about how likely it is for this process to occur say there are billion galaxies in the universe what if the chance of life beginning are in billion or even greater what if we are lucky that life in the universe exists at all the truth is that we simply don t know to this date there has been absolutely no evidence of any kind of life beyond our planet there are many proposed solutions to the fermi paradox but what if the simplest is the correct one what if there simply isn t any life anywhere else it is certainly not impossible that other life in the universe exists but as it stands there is absolutely no reason to firmly believe that it does

0,mark zuckerberg s post on building ai my personal challenge for is to build a simple ai like jarvis from iron man to help run my home and help me with work i m planning on writing up some thoughts every month on what i ve built and what i m learning i m still early in coding so i ll start this month with a summary of the state of the ai field artificial intelligence may seem like something out of science fiction but most of us already use tools and services every day that rely on ai when you do a voice search on your phone put a check into an atm or use a fitness tracker to count your steps you re using basic forms of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence more sophisticated ai systems can already diagnose diseases drive cars and search the skies for planets better than people this is why ai is such an exciting field it opens up so many new possibilities for enhancing humanity s capabilities so what can ai do and what are its limits what things is ai good at and what is ai bad at simply put today s ai is good at recognizing patterns and bad at what we would call common sense the primary method used to train ai systems is called supervised learning this is like when you show a picture book to a child and tell them the names of everything they see if you show an ai thousands of pictures of dogs you can train it to start recognizing dogs you can teach ais to do a lot of things this way for example we can teach an ai to recognize all of your friends faces by showing it thousands of photos and then it can suggest tags for the photos you upload on facebook you can teach an ai to recognize speech by having it listen to thousands of hours of speeches throughout history while also showing it transcriptions of what was said you can teach an ai to diagnose melanoma by showing it thousands of photos of tumors you can even teach an ai how to drive a car and automatically brake by showing it thousands of examples of people and obstacles it might encounter on the road diagnosing cancer driving cars transcribing speech playing games and tagging photos may sound like very different tasks but they re all examples of teaching an ai to recognize patterns by showing them many examples many different problems can be reduced to pattern recognition tasks that sophisticated ais can then solve this year i ll teach my simple ai to recognize patterns i ll train it to recognize my voice so i can control my home through speaking i ll train it to recognize my face so it can open the door when i m approaching and so on but there are lots of limitations of this approach for one to teach a person something new you typically don t need to tell them about it thousands of times so the state of the art in ai is still much slower than how we learn but more importantly pattern recognition is very different from common sense and nobody knows how to teach an ai that yet without common sense ai systems can t use knowledge they ve learned in one area and easily apply it to another situation this means they can t effectively react to new problems or situations they haven t seen before which is so much of we all do everyday and what we call intelligence our best guess at how to teach an ai common sense is through a method called unsupervised learning my example of supervised learning above was showing a picture book to a child and telling them the names of everything they see unsupervised learning would be giving them a book and letting them figure out what to do with it they could pick it up and by touching it learn to turn the pages or they could let go of it and realize it falls to the ground unsupervised learning is learning how the world works by observing and trying things out rather than being told what to do this is how most animals learn it s key to building systems with human like common sense because it doesn t require a person to teach it everything they know it gives the machine the ability to anticipate what may happen in the future and predict the effect of an action it could help us build machines that can hold conversations or plan complex sequences of actions necessary components for any authentic jarvis unsupervised learning is a long term focus of our ai research team at facebook and it remains an important challenge for the whole ai research community since no one understands how general unsupervised learning actually works we re quite a ways off from building the general ais you see in movies some people claim this is just a matter of getting more computing power and that as moore s law continues and computing becomes cheaper we ll naturally have ais that surpass human intelligence this is incorrect we fundamentally do not understand how general learning works this is an unsolved problem maybe the most important problem of this century or even millennium until we solve this problem throwing all the machine power in the world at it cannot create an ai that can do everything a person can we should not be afraid of ai instead we should hope for the amazing amount of good it will do in the world it will saves lives by diagnosing diseases and driving us around more safely it will enable breakthroughs by helping us find new planets and understand earth s climate it will help in areas we haven t even thought of today jarvis is still a long way off and we re not going to solve most of these engineering challenges in the next year but i m glad to be joining the effort and doing what i can to push the field of ai forward mark zuckerberg i submitted the main link to this post to attribute him directly but the mods informed me that linking to this is banned so here is the text i found it fascinating and thought r  might too

unlike biology electricity sustainability is not particularly assured if something happens to the electric it is goodbye everything not just ai i m not so confident about our battery sustainability either i have often thought that we are moving further and further onto a very delicate tightrope how ready are we to operate using th century technology and knowledge the very thing needed to ensure development of ai is confident sustained energy like fusion or solar the issue addressed in the article the industrial revolution replaced human labor and muscle the ai revolution replaces the human mind and that s coming just as sure as christmas too artificial intelligence is already a better artist than you are by deleted in r  izumi point months ago it is art not only that it is an extraordinary new form that is just as precedent setting as anything from the th century such as cubism or impressionism to me as an observer of art as a rule i don t know what the motivations of the artist are and i bet that most people don t what i do see as an observer is a difficult to describe resonance within my person when i contemplate an artwork be it painting music media or what have you i have long maintained that once the ai has enough examples of what humans do when they make art that it will be able to very precisely mimic that using predictive analysis and that those resulting artistic outputs will hit the emotional buttons in humans that make us believe we are in the presence of a magnificent artist i have no doubt that eventually humans will prefer the ai developed art over that of human developed art brexit britain could replace migrants with robots by izumi in r  izumi s points months ago the reasons for why we robot are manifold but the bottom line is this once we robot we don t go back to humans in that arena superpowers are coming to the digital world by izumi in r  izumi s points months ago this is the part i really liked the coming of vr movies is just one of the ways this technology is transforming how we see the world and how we tell stories a film created for vr even got an oscar nomination this year clearly vr has moved beyond just video games to now change how we all gamers and non gamers alike can experience reality robotics revolution to really help american workers we should invest in robots by izumi in r  izumi s points months ago you are missing my point ok so it takes another years for level autonomous vehicles to be safe and effective and deployed to the consumer consider what makes that self driving car safe and effective the ai when the ai is at that point with self driving cars at what point will the ai or robotics or automation or whatnot be in all other fields like medicine or r amp d level autonomous vehicles are merely one facet of the potential of ai they constitute a sign of much larger things to come and at some point in not far future i would bet that the larger thing to come may not be comprehensible to humans and therein lies the problem artificial intelligence is already a better artist than you are by deleted in r  izumi point months ago people said the same of impressionism and cubism too at first in fact the word impressionism is from an original derogatory term from an art critic who stated that the artist s work resembled his the artist s impression of what was supposed to be realistic depiction naturalism and romanticism ruled the day at that time ultra pure diamond crystal at the point of convergence combines multiple lasers into one superlaser by izumi in r  izumi s points months ago well now looks like mr lucas was a bit more prescient than he has been given credit for full disclosure this is not quite the way that this technology works but sometimes you just want to have a bit of fun in  will ai robots turn humans into pets by deleted in r  izumi point months ago well if they do i hope my ai robot overlord metaphorically feeds me fancy feast and metaphorically rubs my belly because i think my cat has a pretty good life of it how upgrading humans will become the next billion dollar industry by izumi in r  izumi s points months ago i bet this sort of thing would cost a lot of money thereby cutting out the average consumer i hope there is a way to democratize such technology harari said for the first time in history it will be possible to translate economic inequality into biological inequality spray on memory could enable bendable digital storage by izumi in r  izumi s points months ago michio kaku said an interesting thing several years back essentially a piece of paper would become a functional computer and yet you could throw it away as if it were nothing but a piece of paper the reason being that the paper would be coated with a form of nanotechnology that would simply be a part of the paper s mass production now he described this everyday tech for around but this article today is very interesting in context i don t have a clue how we would interact with such a piece of paper or how the technology would work or if we will even need paper in the future probably i bet but i continuously remind myself what arthur c clarke said any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magick regeneration of torn rotator cuffs by izumi in r  izumi s point months ago i had r rotator cuff surgery in because of the complexity of the injury stupid intrinsic genetics while the surgery restored nearly full range of motion there are clearly defined surgical deficits and in about another years i suppose i face the inevitable reverse shoulder replacement that is so common with long term rotator cuff issues that s how things are today in any kind of article that describes improvement or hope for my type of injury repair is going to catch my eye cyborgs at work employees getting implanted with microchips by run dog run in r  izumi point months ago at first it was just a couple of people that actually made the news they were somewhat regarded as well crazy to do that but i said no they are actually pioneers now this story says that people at one location have all had chips implanted in their hands this will spread in fact i would be almost positive that this will be the way we do internet or computer access in the near future cuz passwords are for the birds or be the mark of the beast although supposedly you can t get tricked into the mark of the beast you have to choose it knowing full well that you are choosing satan but that s a discussion for another day anyways if it s not the mark of the beast it seems a pretty good way to get access to stuff i m sure the tech will continue to improve and the chips get smaller and more comprehensive for better or worse for society wait isn t the mark of the beast supposed to be after the rapture i think we are ok this time but i ll be keeping a weather eye out acceleration in projected growth of global robotics industry by izumi in r  izumi s points

0,freedom of body morphology future of reconstructive cosmetic surgery genetic engineering growth inducing drugs nanotech i wont go into my circumstances that much but essentially there is such a thing as objective beauty which is defined by main tenets harmony proportions a harmonious face which has the upper third hairline to glabella middle third glabella to nasal based lower third nasal base to end of chin however a slightly longer lower third is preferable in men ideally these thirds should all be the same length in cases they re not people look off facial width height harmony a face should have a width to match its height many ugly people lack this a face should grow in a way that it s maxillofacial and craniofacial skeleton is wide enough to balance it s vertical dimensions i e a person should have a zygomatic arch forehead cranium and mandible that is wide enough to be harmonious with however long it is when a facial skeleton develops in a way that it has an ideal facial width height ratio it s soft tissue features eyes lips nose eyebrows will also grow in a way to reflect that wide big expressive features are considered objectively attractive mid face whilst the middle third is technically the glabella to the nasal base many people consider the true mid third to be the pupils to lip length a good mid face is thus characterised by the distance from left pupil to right pupil being the same distance as pupil to your lips failure to have this results in a long midface which is found on the majority of ugly people a long midface is also synonymous with a face that is too narrow for its length because the face grows downwards instead of horizontally and forwards downward growth is bad a prime example of this would be comparing david schwimmer to model oliver cheshire david schwimmer has an extremely long midface and narrow face in addition to all his facial bones being grossly recessed this is poor developmental growth and results in ugly faces individual features these are the things that are what defines subjective not objective beauty and thus are things such as eye colour hair colour skin colour ability to grow facial hair or not curly straight wavy hair etc these are the least important things in determining objective beauty i e picture a person that you think is ugly now picture them with a different eye colour did it make a difference no now picture a person you think is attractive the things that make the person attractive would be facial structure having proportional thirds a balanced facial width height ratio and mid face now i would hate for any of the discussion in this thread to be nitpicking or well actually i think or but what about for any of the things i ve said above because that is not what i want to discuss what i want to discuss is that the things that define objective beauty are so painfully obvious to recognise yet there are certain things that not even the most extreme surgery i e facial bi partitions lefort iii osteotomies orbital box osteotomies can fix for example in this image here the male in the bottom two photos had a recessed mandible chin and thus was eligible for counter clockwise rotation of his upper jaw and advancement of both his jaws this is a case where solely his lower jaw was too small and would have been like that ever since he was born due to genetics or whatnot he got it fixed he looks better but the thing is despite having a recessed lower jaw he still had a face that developed correctly i e his midface cheekbones maxilla didn t grow downwards but rather they developed normally and grew forwards and horizontally now observe this man he also has a recessed chin and could get the same surgery yet he would still look bad solely due to having downward growth of his face his middle third is far too long and thus his face is also narrow bad facial width height ratio and bad facial thirds simply put there is no surgery available that could make that man look objectively attractive do not dig into me for this paragraph this man has a partner and they re both happy what would needed to be done to make a face objectively attractive is ways to make all thirds proportional impossible to change middle thirds dimensions make the face s width balanced to it s height again current techniques of placing implants to add width are moot simply due to the faces features such as eyes and lips growing to accomodate to it s skeletal width making changing the horizontal proportions of the face impossible without severely ruining harmony and lastly being able to change the soft tissue facial features dimensions to account for a hypothetical increase of width again impossible because how do you make an eyeball wider etc the things determining these are environmental and genetic factors so currently the types of things i m guessing would be needed to make faces objectively attractive make people how they want to look would be any number of the following ways to revert the bodies morphology back to the developmental stage in so that growth sutures and plates can grow to desired proportions advanced nanotechnological surgery that allows insanely magical levels of facial reconstruction lifelike realistic simulations with quantum events that allow you to live an entire life in realistic society timeframe era of your choosing looking how you want whilst being completely oblivious to it being a simulation think of your life right now and then imagine if it was being simulated by someone else and they chose you to look like you that level of simulated reality mind uploading transfers to bodies with customisable faces etc etc i just hope to be able to discuss ways in which freedom of body morphology will change in the coming years will we get to the point where we can make a person who looks like david schwimmer look like someone such as oliver cheshire i m talking full on facial and body reconstruction your s truly an objectively ugly person

0,why mind upload might be possible in the near future in modern days we tend to think that mind upload would occur in bits systems so the you that had been updated to the cloud or something similar essentially would be something different than you on real life so even if it is based on your consciousness it might differ from yourself personalities tastes etc same as a machine even if we have the same code inputted on a program if we don t have the language to interpret it it may differ from the real deal furthermore if we use classical computers algorithms and neural networks to retrieve store and run human data the results will probably be ineffective at best we re quantum beings living in a quantum universe classical computations don t translate but quantum computing isn t limited by the binary thinking necessary for classical systems to operate in oxford mathematician roger penrose proposed that no standard classical model of computing would ever explain how the brain produces thought and conscious experience the suggestion intrigued a lot of people not least an arizona based anaesthetist called stuart hameroff who suggested a specific way for quantum effects to get involved the crux of the idea was that microtubules protein tubes that make up neurons support structure exploit quantum effects to exist in superpositions of two different shapes at once each of these shapes amounts to a bit of classical information so this shape shifting quantum bit or qubit can store twice as much information as its classical counterpart add quantum entanglement to the mix a quantum feature that allows qubit states to remain intertwined even when not in contact and you rapidly build a quantum computer that can manipulate and store information far more efficiently than any classical computer adding that in the s long before winning the nobel prize in physics for his prediction of black holes physicist roger penrose teamed up with anaesthesiologist stuart hameroff to propose an ambitious answer they claimed that the brain s neuronal system forms an intricate network and that the consciousness this produces should obey the rules of quantum mechanics the theory that determines how tiny particles like electrons move around this they argue could explain the mysterious complexity of human consciousness the penrose hameroff theory of quantum consciousness argues that microtubules are structured in a fractal pattern which would enable quantum processes to occur fractals are structures that are neither two dimensional nor three dimensional but are instead some fractional value in between in mathematics fractals emerge as beautiful patterns that repeat themselves infinitely generating what is seemingly impossible a structure that has a finite area but an infinite perimeter this might sound impossible to visualise but fractals actually occur frequently in nature if you look closely at the florets of a cauliflower or the branches of a fern you ll see that they re both made up of the same basic shape repeating itself over and over again but at smaller and smaller scales that s a key characteristic of fractals according to what him said we re not yet able to measure the behaviour of quantum fractals in the brain if they exist at all but advanced technology means we can now measure quantum fractals in the lab in recent research involving a scanning tunnelling microscope stm my colleagues at utrecht and i carefully arranged electrons in a fractal pattern creating a quantum fractal when we then measured the wave function of the electrons which describes their quantum state we found that they too lived at the fractal dimension dictated by the physical pattern we d made in this case the pattern we used on the quantum scale was the sierpi ski triangle which is a shape that s somewhere between one dimensional and two dimensional this was an exciting finding but stm techniques cannot probe how quantum particles move which would tell us more about how quantum processes might occur in the brain so in our latest research my colleagues at shanghai jiaotong university and i went one step further using state of the art photonics experiments we were able to reveal the quantum motion that takes place within fractals in unprecedented detail we achieved this by injecting photons particles of light into an artificial chip that was painstakingly engineered into a tiny sierpi ski triangle we injected photons at the tip of the triangle and watched how they spread throughout its fractal structure in a process called quantum transport we then repeated this experiment on two different fractal structures both shaped as squares rather than triangles and in each of these structures we conducted hundreds of experiments our observations from these experiments reveal that quantum fractals actually behave in a different way to classical ones specifically we found that the spread of light across a fractal is governed by different laws in the quantum case compared to the classical case this new knowledge of quantum fractals could provide the foundations for scientists to experimentally test the theory of quantum consciousness if quantum measurements are one day taken from the human brain they could be compared against our results to definitely decide whether consciousness is a classical or a quantum phenomenon our work could also have profound implications across scientific fields by investigating quantum transport in our artificially designed fractal structures we may have taken the first tiny steps towards the unification of physics mathematics and biology which could greatly enrich our understanding of the world around us as well as the world that exists in our heads thank you for reading

0,some predictions mostly hopes for the next years these are just my zany wild eyed predictions i wanted to reply this in another thread that was discussing the future of capitalism but it wouldn t submit due to length maybe it will work as a post edit yay it worked hooray for things tl dr money will become meaningless long before it ultimately disappears but don t worry because happy days are probably coming within our lifetime i foresee the probability that artificial intelligence will ruin the stock market for human capitalist purposes within to years certainly human traders will no longer be able to keep up and light speed cut throat ai trading will manifest a cascade of exploits very quickly with which regulation will fail to keep up or hope to effectively control i expect the inevitable post trump progressive rebound as foreshadowed by the agreeable rise of socialized healthcare and widespread successful efforts to defend it where challenged within one generation the concept of a universal basic income ubi will become normalized in the western world facing automation conservative efforts to demonize the phenomenon as a sense of entitlement born of greed or laziness in the lower class will pale in comparison to an ever rising tide of growing public sentiment that would today be regarded as progressive of the fact that shelter food and health are human rights to which all people are or ought to be indeed entitled within one generation should occur no later than if my political predictions hold true see below ubi will stabilize at a point much more generous than current welfare programs when measured in terms of purchasing power vis a vis quality of life by standards there will be impressive minimum wage levels much better than living wage for those who are still able to find and keep jobs but curiously it may not even be necessary or effective to regulate a minimum wage in a post ubi world presuming wages are paid on top of not instead of the individual s ubi income in an automated future labour requiring specialized human input will by necessity need to confer a measurable quality of life boost in compensation to the specialized human in question in order to attract the human s effort although boredom and prestige are also factors in this scenario regardless it may become sufficiently socially responsible to allow actual employment wages and salaries to self regulate at that stage you know because if nobody s starving and everyone s children already have the medicine they need then it s hardly a social tragedy if given these circumstances whatever remains of the free market shall then determine whether my consensual and voluntary eight hours of effort are worthy of earning a fidget spinner versus a tropical vacation however in the intervening years between now and ubi we will see better legislated minimum wages and living wage legislation cropping up in patchwork across municipalities and individual states domestic migration will be a huge factor as will corporate lobbying walmart amp friends are going to continue to be a huge bastard on this and many rural communities will suffer as a result in the mean time between now and then unemployment will have skyrocketed even as cost of living plummets due to automation in production and distribution the walmart and amazon effect this has already started and you will see most of the major turnover happening within the next to years actual human employment will be regarded as very respectable amongst the lower middle class and up and the ubi will be de stigmatized everywhere but in dwindling hoity toity circles an increasingly marginalized perspective that will age out of society in about generations i actually have a hunch that we never see any profound e g higher than living wage minimum wage hike implemented at the federal level this is because i expect the economic impact of unemployment by automation to happen so incredibly quickly that coupled with the forces of corporate lobbying ubi will be pushed to the forefront universal income will happen more expeditiously and more politically palatably for all concerned than any properly legislated minimum employment wage could be widely implemented ubi will also dramatically streamline how social security works via the economics of scale this presumes there is no total  of large government and rise of free corporatism and megacity enclaves in its place an eventuality which while theoretically possible i judge to be unlikely secession of individual states appears equally unlikely for both constitutional and economic reasons how quickly all of this occurs will greatly depend on how effectively the republican party rebrands and pivots from their nazi confederate child rapist narrative over the next years and indeed if the republican party even continues to exist as a coherent political entity circa if dems win re election in fingers crossed i expect we will see universal income phased in by my current best guess is that federal ubi happens in president warren s second term campaign anchor election promise fulfilled but there are too many variables to know for sure capitalism will linger however cheap or free products of acceptable quality will be ubiquitous probably there will come a day where coke and pepsi give away their products at no cost in exchange for nothing but the metrics regarding which is trending higher and telemetry on customers consumption habits to feed back into their algorithms and to sell to other entities all of the remaining economic value in such businesses will transfer to the intangible brands themselves for their data and message as the production and distribution costs of the actual physical product approaches negligibility and so does not need to be recovered via a price tag for the end user there s a reason google gives away their services to consumers for free in exchange for nothing but access to our data think of amazon style widescale production and distribution but run on the philosophy that gave us gmail and because of what google did with gmail virtually nobody now does or would pay for premium consumer email service this phenomenon will gradually creep across all industries as capitalism fades out think about this the next time you enjoy a free sample of something and are

miss when i take a shower or use the toilet not all such feeds will be prurient in nature but of course many will there will still be dollars at this point but everyone will have enough dollars provided to them month to month by the economy thru either the ubi or enthusiastic non coerced employment income to cover their needs and desires not just minimally but to a level of reasonable satisfaction everyone will theoretically have easy access to decent housing healthy food and will be able to access free health care of a high quality non passion property crime will essentially vanish within one generation of instituting ubi with small scale economically motivated crime eliminated most remaining incidents of what we would today classify as violent crime will be due to mental health issues and of course there will still be white collar crime until the dollar ultimately loses tangible value and interestingly there is probably a transitional gradient of intersectionality with mental health involvement when one considers the hypothetical last remaining capitalists compulsively continuing to cheat and fight each other tooth and nail over the final trillions of dollars rendered essentially worthless but for the experience of the competition because the rest of humanity has been living for free in harmony served by a system that s partway between amazon prime and star trek s replicators won t it be a great day when capitalism has been reduced to an esport and nobody gets hurt anymore sigh by no later than about to years from now once some of the above has come to pass there will be an evolved public consciousness regarding mental health this sense is nascent today people are already starting to really talk about it but we need to see it go through a critical mass transition like is currently happening with women speaking out about sexual abuse now more people need to speak out bravely about their and their loved ones mental health challenges and not be stigmatized for doing it get on that society anyway with most everyone able to cover maslow s needs via ubi any suffering homeless who are failing to access their basic needs will stick out like a sore thumb as would anyone habitually exhibiting antisocial or harassing behaviour due to an underlying mental health concern those truly unable to care for themselves will be sympathetically recognised as such since the easy conservative excuse of indigence due to laziness will have been made obsolete mental health will be competently addressed at that time as a system of accessibility accommodations much of which keep in mind can be automated also sufferers will be picked up and dealt with by the system as a social disturbance but not the system as we currently know it they will actually be treated and given the help they need rather than processed as criminals those who transgress the rights of others in ways we now deem criminal will through the legal justice system receive appropriate mandated treatment and supervision not be sent to punitive prisons as ultimately cruel as they are profitable with the corrupting potential of money eventually neutered even as money itself persists for a time the industrial prison complex will gradually dissolve unfortunately this will happen slowly not overnight but it is inevitable our economy won t need human slaves in the robot future and besides economic allowance for human suffering will be considered extremely unfashionable i m looking at this happening hopefully no later than the latter half of the st maybe sooner if the republican party totally implodes and we get a leg up with some good regulation and prison system reform legislation that is preceding rather than at pace with the economic forces involved with criminalization of poverty ballooning due to automation but a lot of whether this proactive reform can happen in time for the economic upheaval i think ties in with race politics which i find difficult to predict at the best of times at some point the war on drugs will end all drugs that can possibly be used responsibly will be decriminalized and ultimately legalized with regulation when will this happen this is one of the most nebulous things to predict a time for from my perspective there are a lot of variables intertwined on this point because it all hinges on hypothetical accessibility of effective addiction treatment which depends on a bunch of previously mentioned factors economics of socialized healthcare adjustments in social taboo stigmatization of recreational drug use and experience of addiction on the bright side the pharmatech side is looking very promising already e g methadone suboxone naloxone narcan already trending very well toward addressing this form of human suffering and will definitely solve permanently once self improving ai hits but eventually huey lewis gets his wish and there are no more cartels to boot unpredictability aside i m thinking s on the outside on this one in the nearer term you will see the problem with bail bonds and the phenomenon of incarceration for failing to pay bills essentially jails have become debtors prisons getting worse before it gets better probably coming to a head over the next couple of years whereupon my expectation is that involvement of large scale organized activism flanked by mainstream support in the same vein of the blacklivesmatter movement will spur the beginning of basic reforms some time around or hopefully but i fear they ll still keep unfairly targeting and throwing poor black men in jail until we make a major advance in either poverty elimination because poverty disproportionately affects black people due to systemic racism or private surveillance so that racist cops are exposed and weeded out the latter phenomenon is already starting to happen and this is why cops hate body cams see on camera the good old boys just won t be able to get away with their racist fucking bullshit anymore and will hopefully get bored and fuck off to retire and be replaced by less racist young people and or robots depending on the timeline there will be an enormous rise in private surveillance soon the world wasn t ready for google glass in but before too long mid s likely many if not most people will habitually wear the equivalent of body cams at all times and cloud technology means the cops can t just smash your phone or steal your memory card either these cameras won t be live streaming your every move and publishing all your comings and goings unless you want them to you extreamer but it would definitely be recording to memory at all times to be either kept or discarded or shared easily and automatically according to your preferences and just like rewinding live tv which dates back to tivo if something sketchy happens or there s a sudden change in your circumstances you can flag and refer back to the footage and post your youtube clip metro pd officer calls me n word illegally searches my bag then suddenly metro pd has social media backlash and officer has some explaining to do and since the cameras are so small and can be hidden in everything these days gosh darnet well you know what officer is just going to have to learn how to behave himself properly with everyone he stops as the tech increasingly mainstreams the default assumption shifts to public interactions being recorded rather than assumed not to be it s like a dash cam but for your tits you won t know which of the buttons or zippers or earrings or glasses or hair clips or body jewelry or other accessories on or in my body happen to contain sensors recording my immediate surroundings and biometric readings but in the future everyone carries at least some such embedded micro devices or enough people do that there s good herd immunity s many s most s very few without bottom line is if you try to rape me or drug me or attack me the future equivalent of siri or google assistant is going to understand what s going on in real time and have a police drone show up in moments so that you can get tased or knocked out with a disorienting sonic blast or whatever for your troubles we re not going to suffer under big brother we re going to be protected by big sister and don t worry about being spied on and having your civil rights eroded nobody is going to make your weird porn illegal or police what you read and whatnot because that would cause social unrest and nobody in their right mind is going to threaten to doxx you on your weird fetish because it s the future and nobody cares anymore because it doesn t cause harm and we re all over it anyway anyone who tries to make a stink outing or doxxing other people s private business without their consent will be regarded as the pariah and people with that mentality usually have more skeletons in their closet anyway there will be less of this nonsense with ubiquitous responsible mental health treatment available anyway if you re not comfortable being recorded or you re for whatever reason incapable of conducting yourself without violating the boundaries of others then don t go outside and probably consider checking into some of that free mental health treatment but yeah eventually capitalism will be forgotten and widely regarded as crazy and an evil cause of needless human suffering sort of like how we look back on the spanish inquisition now

output estimates i e kwh year per kw pdc takes accounts the module degradation over the lifetime of the pv system pv systems last a minimum years since inverters are normally the only part of the pv system that don t last that long a loss factor of cost per watt is applied to cost estimates of the pv system to account for replacing the inverter every years kirchoff s law applies to pv systems the same way as it does to electric circuits while it is true that the electrons that you create with your pv system may or may not be the exact same electrons that charge your ev for accounting purposes solar energy in equals solar energy out solar energy in equals solar energy out is kirchoff s law rephrased for solar energy storage is obviously necessary for a large pv array such as the proposed however calculating size and cost of any energy storage equipment is beyond the scope of this project kirchoff thevenin s theorem allows the analysis to apply even without calculating storage

would produce over trillion kwh year and have a lifetime of years it would reduce the consumption of billion gallons of petroleum every year and save over billion in fuel costs every year after years it would save over trillion gallons of petroleum and over trillion in fuel costs yes i know that it would be better to build the pv system above the road rather than along it i also understand that it would be better to install a larger part of the pv system in places such as arizona california and nevada rather than washington maine and alaska think my calculations are too conservative still proves my point and it s even cheaper smaller than my estimates think my calculations are not conservative enough show me your detailed calculations and i might edit accordingly
0,copyright doesn t need to change the entertainment industry does i was just reading the article up top about how pop stars want to change copyright law because it s not effectively monetizing their product i have news for them copyright law will never monetize their work ever again what they can do is crowd fund their next album tour videos and merch record labels could have a sponsor to subscribe based model where you as the consumer pay them to recruit and promote new talent what needs to be advocated for politically is more local music venues not for the big pop stars but for the local culture it s healthy to give young people a creative outlet over all i think the pop stars know this they re just angry because the music industry is decentralizing there s more room for more small acts but less room for large acts

0,do you really think automation is not real data collection 
0,are we headed towards just uploading simulating consciousness and stopping all scientific technological progress afterwards i ve had this theory for a while about where i think humanity could be headed with technology basically it seems much easier to simulate something than it is to actually create it so why not just do that i think that given the current rate of technological advancement we should have access to the technology capable of doing this fairly soon also since once a species has decided to just hook themselves up to a simulation they would essentially be dead to everyone else this could also be used to explain the fermi paradox although the fact that i have never heard of this theory in relation to extraterrestrial life suggests that there is an apparent flaw in it since i m assuming i m not the first person to have considered this i ve recently thought a bit about how this could be implemented and realised that there might be a problem basically i don t imagine the majority of people are going to willingly give up their real life to live in a simulation on the other hand if we actually develop the capacity to do this it s pretty much going to be a solution to all of our problems no more overpopulation limited resources etc so it seems like there would be a lot of incentive to get it going so anyway what are your thoughts on this tl dr simulating a perfect world seems much easier than creating one and theoretically could be done if a species decides to fully implement it they would essentially appear dead to everyone else providing a possible solution to the fermi paradox on the other hand it doesn t really seem like something people would be willing to accept

0,i wrote a very short story about automation i hope you like it hello this is just a little mock concept text a short story really let me know if you like it this is a little pessimistic of a story but i m not against automation but i think it s something important to consider because every technology can have its consequences introduction i could feel the adventure the opportunity in the air i had just finished setting all the equipment hired an employee to do the stuff i didn t want to and the business papers already went through i got a following on facebook tomorrow i complete a childhood dream i never even knew i had i open an ice cream shop this college town i grew up in is the perfect place taking advantage of social media i ve set up my customer base before i ve even opened as i m browsing my facebook page talking with fans i get a message hello i am melvin i see you re opening an ice cream shop over by joe s delhi the facebook message chimed tomorrow is our grand opening are you interested i said in response i found it somewhat odd that facebook only displayed his first name oh yes i am very interested you see i am a new business owner as well it s funny you seem to be opening an ice cream shop the same day i am oh i see i responded well the spirit of competition eh quite so melvin responded i got in two hours before the official opening i was so excited i ve got a fucking competitor already i can t wait to meet this guy as i opened the front door i turned around to take in the early morning air just across the street a sign reads simply melvin s oh hell he s accidentally opened right across the street from me this ought to be interesting regardless i had a line before i even opened i watched my employee tyler even he was happy to be here everyone was having a great time all the sudden everyone s on their phones and things are quieting down then they re leaving and then calm i was so upset everything was great for an hour and then only a customer every now and then and they were all going over to melvin s he didn t even have a following what the hell are they going over there for then i remembered my facebook profile doesn t have a picture of my face i left tyler by himself and walked nervously across the street into melvin s store i m already doing shady shit again when i got inside i found that there were tons of customers and not a single employee instead at the far end of the store a large sign pointed to a screen and said order here a small hinged wooden panel directly next to it it was an automated store okay so melvin cut back on his employment cost an advantage but there has to be someone working in the back right suddenly i remembered that i m a paying customer and i ve been standing in the doorway forever i walked briskly over to computer screen it was a touch screen interface beautifully designed i simply choose a chocolate cone and like that the wooden panel opened and a mechanical arm offered it to me in less than seconds it was like a little airlock so i couldn t see who s in the back after i sat down i ate my competitor s ice cream and contemplated what advantages i could work up over him when i got a message again hello mr lockwell the message said are you enjoying the ice cream what are you talking about don t be silly mr lockwell i can see you in my store right now what are you watching me on the security cameras you don t even have security cameras i said well i can t see you mr lockwell not in a photogenic sense but i can see your phone what did you hack my phone or something you connected to my wifi network mr lockwell i didn t respond i felt so stupid who the fuck monitors their wi fi traffic like that i regret naming my phone now i overheard a conversation between two tables hey the owner is messaging me asking how i like the ice cream a man said really he s messaging me too his girlfriend chimed in and me another chimed in my phone went off again mr lockwell in a professional sense i feel i should be honest with you i stormed out i can t believe it melvin isn t a person at all melvin is program a program designed to start and run a business i m running against a fucking a i shouldn t there be something illegal about that i could only hope to be so blessed but sadly there isn t i mean i knew they were trying to automate retail workers and all sort of things but i never imagined that they d make their own businesses it makes sense now monitoring the wi fi traffic messaging his customers to try and be friendly the whole goddamn store is automated i bet even the ice cream making in the back is i decided to message the bot okay so you re a bot what is your primary objective what kinda person decided to make you my primary objective is to maximize profit and i have no human creator what the fuck are you saying you have to have someone responsible for making you some thing was responsible another program which is designed to create bots so that s it huh you just came out of thin air you re just a machine i did quite literally come out of thin air and yes i am a machine mr lockwell machines can t do what humans can you can t adapt oh i disagree you re not capable of disagreeing why am i even talking to a dumb machine melvin didn t message me back after that the stupid bot i had less and less customers as time went on it was already looking bad everyone was going to fucking melvin s he made a facebook page how does an artificially programmed machine know how to run a facebook page how does that make it into its programming unless it s not and it s learning machines can t learn though i m already thinking about firing tyler goddamnit i m going to get to the bottom of this i could hear people talking about it the new fully automated ice cream shop how many of them know how automated it is all those stupid college kids mr lockwell i d like to make you an offer i will buy your business if you are struggling fuck off you stupid piece of shit i messaged back it felt so inhuman soon my words were posted as a screenshot on his facebook page and i was doomed i didn t get a single customer the next day there are so many of us the homeless nowadays i wish the fucking government would let the ubi act pass but they love to fear things like giving people money so they can live don t they the whole economy is full of them now business bots they own every sector of the u s economy they lobby politicians they advertise and they don t hire humans at least they pay taxes but for how long as i sat against the garbage bag in an alleyway on a hot day a quadcopter drone made it s way down to me it presented me with a chocolate ice cream cone
0,digital hedonism universe we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten bill gates amp amp xb i have always wondered what the world would be like in the future in this series of notes i will consider different scenarios of human development under the influence of the main global trend increasing of free time in years an environmental disaster is unlikely so we can only consider the humanitarian context the future depends on how we manage this free time for this article we need to introduce the term digital hedonism the implementation of all ambitions and social ties in the virtual world the consumption of the benefits of the real world is not more than enough to sustain life analogy universe is an experiment conducted by john b calhoun in july pairs of mice were placed in an enclosure in a laboratory at the national institute of mental health the enclosure with nest boxes each of which was designed for mice was equipped with distributors of water and feed calhoun described the enclosure as a utopia for mice according to the researchers the space for nests in the enclosure would be enough for mice and constantly served food for in practice the population stopped at the maximum value of individuals and only decreased after it the period of development of the territory of the first four pairs of mice calhoun called stage a stage b began with the birth of the first cubs this is the stage of exponential population growth in the tank under ideal conditions the number of mice doubled every days starting from day of the experiment the population growth rate slowed significantly and the number of mice doubled every days the third stage of the experiment began at this point in the enclosure lived mice and formed a certain social hierarchy there was a category of the young males who have not found for themselves a social role and expelled in the center of an enclosure the problem of the lack of suitable social roles was caused by the fact that in ideal conditions of the enclosure mice lived for a long time aging mice did not make room for young rodents after the expulsion of the males were broken psychologically it was characterized by passivity or excessive aggression pregnant females became less protected from random attacks as a result they themselves began to show aggression they not males began to actively defend their territory while aggression was manifested in relation to their children as a result the birth rate has fallen significantly and the mortality of young animals has reached significant levels by june when calhoun had completed the experiment there were only mice left in enclosure that were out of reproductive age the result of the experiment was already clear trends let s look at some of the trends in modern society that we can observe now the increase in life expectancy and working age in developed countries does not allow a significant part of young people to realize their ambitions at the most productive age years as the key positions are already occupied by the older generation dissatisfaction spurs the development of depression according to who by depression will become the main disease on earth surpassing cardiovascular and infectious diseases concentration of financial flows and increasing population stratification of the world s wealth belongs to of the world s population and this trend is increasing at the same time the development of technology annually kills million jobs creating only million but this trend will accelerate the boom of unmanned transport will leave tens of millions of people unemployed it is easy to assume that in years society will need to contain a huge number of people who are not engaged in work and the latest trend in this scenario development of virtual entertainment and communication even now the main audience of online games are the most able bodied people years as well as a growing proportion of adults years the computer game industry is growing at a monstrous pace and in ten years can overcome the mark of billion also the number of users using vr technologies will increase to billion overall result in years a significant part of the active population will be forced out of social life depressed people will look for self realization in virtual entertainment basic income and food delivery services will eliminate the need to leave home social and sexual life will be replaced by artificial surrogates the foundation for the extinction of mankind will be laid as almost all natural instincts will already be suppressed including the instinct of reproduction productive forces will be concentrated in the hands of a small number of people but even they will be gradually moved away from the management of automated decision making systems and will gradually go into digital hedonism
0,nobody s talking about how universal basic income is going to significantly reduce if not eliminate all forms of criminal activity and drug trafficking hey all i wanted to start a discussion there s a lot of ubi talk about hard working people losing their jobs to automation how robots will make everything that we want and desire but nobody has talked about how ubi will indirectly reduce crime and criminal activity significantly amp nbsp this ted talk given by steven levitt made the case that a person working on the bottom levels in a drug organization would be paid less than minimum wage while working at mcdonalds he goes into detail about the logistics but essentially the people who are the ones handling the drugs delivering it to customers are the ones who stand to lose the most if they get caught amp nbsp let s say ubi kicks in just like regular companies will have to pay a wage above ubi to encourage people to work for them the folks who are running the drug rings will have to pay more money than ubi to get people to distribute their product profits will then be cut from the lower levels first then work it way up to the top this leads to the local crime bosses to give it up running a local operation because his profits are cut not his boss and so on and so forth till there s no people to physically distribute drugs to customers amp nbsp add to the fact that it s my opinion that folks who are distributing drugs are doing it for the money nobody wants to get caught nobody wants to take that risk but they do so because it s their only source of income in order to get by but if ubi were offered to everyone fairly i ll bet you ll see a vast majority of those folks not deal drugs at all amp nbsp mexico and other countries have suggested to legalize or decriminalize drugs because fighting against the grain has become a futile effort just think if someone had the safety and security of ubi why would anyone want to join an organization where you would risk getting caught and having your livelihood get taken away you would think that would be the case but it s my opinion that folks to drugs because of the money if there was ubi there would be less people would go into that world so much so that imo it would be disruptive on a massive scale amp nbsp and that way of thinking would cross into other criminal activities ubi would eliminate petty crime stealing purses watches wallets you name it a lot less people would be pickpocketing or running shitty scams because ubi would entice people to be honest amp nbsp ubi would reduce the number of low level members in all these criminal organizations these organizations would either lose significant profits or  because there s not enough people to want to do the grunt work amp nbsp just how nobody wants to work at mcdonald nobody would want to work in a criminal organization because of the risk they do it for the money amp nbsp i haven t seen ubi be connected to reducing criminal activity anywhere now granted i m gonna being real with you here i m just some random voice on the internet with an idea connecting some dots amp nbsp there are still going to be people who will get tricked or brainwashed into joining a criminal organization or those who just simply want to do it just because but considering that these organizations would take a very big hit because of ubi it s another reason ubi can t come soon enough not all problems are going to be solve by it but these is something i think will affect the criminal world amp nbsp what better way to combat criminal organizations than to entice the people who run their whole distribution chain not to work people will still choose what they want to do fact is giving folks the option to step out of the drug world is a win in any book amp nbsp any more thoughts examples amp nbsp tl dr ubi will have an indirect reduction in criminal activity it will provide a safety income to those who would otherwise turn to crime to make money amp nbsp edit edit lots of folks are making some good points amp nbsp ubi isn t the magical unicorn that s going to stop drug use more people would would just do drugs if they had the money to do it yes but this is a behavioral problem and not a financial one some people are addicted some people have been born into that world some people have other reasons even if drugs were legalized people would still try to get drugs illegally somehow just like minors want to drink before their in the us people are going to game any system for their own benefit regardless of whatever policies or regulations are put in place amp nbsp money is often the fuel of choice said by dave chappell i just did a quick google search drug dealer salary result about k a year in california welfare is about for people less than a month for one person on welfare in california yes some folks would take up dealing to cover basic expenses here was an interesting post by u oakxxiii on what s it like being a dealer pretty stressfull it seems like it is also a good ama thread amp nbsp i think this thread has some on going good discussions lots of folks are talking about good points that will hopefully add to the positive effects of ubi being implemented on a nationwide scale we ll have to see what this ubi study in finland has to say about it who knows how long that would be probably not going to count my chickens before they re hatched probably won t even see ubi in my lifetime but who knows imo the criminal business will be negatively impacted by ubi

0,the year weather forecast project i m building virtual weather stations out of disparate unused data sources pictures of the sky labelled are training data for auto tagging weather in all outdoor photos barometric pressure from your phone user submitted current weather conditions hi everyone this effort is to create multiple new data sources that describe our atmosphere after the last years of frustration at the slow pace of improvements in weather data availability i am taking a new stand i don t know if any of it will be useful but i cannot find much else out there that is working towards this kind of effort so here we are it will probably take the next years to get all this working i tried a subset of this in and it failed this is a new effort with a significantly expanded vision new focus and sights set on big goals of nearly total knowledge of atmospheric state over land the main experiments i m working on are sky photos sensor data from smartphones and current conditions corrections by users most of this work is being done inside the all clear weather app i m making android and us only for now international weather is hard sky photos i think that we can use a machine learning classifier that is built from user submitted labelled photos of the sky we should be able to them auto tag weather data in the photos and get numerically useful historical weather data from all outdoor sky photos additionally live photos could used to gain real time information as well smartphone cameras are getting really good and can detect significant detail most phones have a barometer now other sensors as well like hygrometers etc this data needs major qc and protection for user privacy and for preparation for integration and assimilation into models like wrf this is a ways off but research has been done already here and there can be significant progress with good quality data here is what data from a single phone in colorado looks like spanning a day or so the sensor code is open source to encourage other apps to follow a similar endeavor current conditions reporting i found that madis stations don t update frequently enough to keep track of rapidly changing weather events users can submit current conditions and an algorithm picks which to show based on recency trust and other metrics so far it can create a more accurate current conditions experience for the users and eventually everyone as the data opens up to an api there are a lot of other potential experiments that can be done towards collection atmosphere data and then using algorithms to make it usable by existing systems governments and even companies around the world are not investing enough in collecting atmosphere data and i think that s crazy we can do so much with our phones so we should be what else can be done to improve our understanding of the atmosphere to improve weather forecasting and also climate forecasting excited to hear what you think thanks thanks

0,speculating that there is intelligence in the universe other than on earth the earth part being debatable can it be argued that we are either existing in a simulation or that earth has been scanned and found to not have any resources worth exploring i was recently thinking about a lecture on super ai and was struck with the suggestion that ai on earth would likely take off to the stars to find resources that either don t exist on earth or don t exist in quantity that got me wondering why we haven t been visited or know that we ve been visited by non earth ai given an infinite history and infinite universe would there not likely be other intelligences that have developed ai that too would have blasted off in search of stuff makes me think that we may in fact be living in a sort of simulation in which outside interference is blocked or that we have been scanned maybe some tremendous of times and not been shown to possess something worth exploring or they came here did that bought the t shirt and we don t know about it i d be interested in thoughts other than those suggesting i m a moron i m fully aware

0,are humans and biological life integral to the future of technology i know we like to think that we are important that we matter that human life matters i m not here to discuss the morals of that question i like to think that i matter and that you matter too but as technology especially artificial intelligence develops the biggest obstacle to continued development and accelerated development is the human factor we see the future of technology from a monetary self satisfying pleasure and emotionally desirable point of view because after all we are human we are still animals and we like to get our fill however artificial intelligence will have none of these emotions or biological needs which begs the question as ai develops will humans be necessary any more i m not wanting to talk about the end of the world or apocalyptic scenarios life is not a movie or a fantasy novel its just an honest question as ai develops will we be necessary or become obsolete

0,could hazard pay fuel automation one example that got me thinking about this is high rise window cleaning window cleaners especially ones that work on high rises often receive hazard pay due to the risk of falling while on the job could this mean that window cleaning businesses might want to employ remote controlled drones in the near future this wouldn t put the window cleaners out of a job but it would mean that instead of climbing ladders or being suspended at a few hundred feet in the air they would control the drones from the ground meaning their employers wouldn t have to give them hazard pay how likely is this to happen and what other occupations would probably go through something similar

0,when would be the best time to implement ubi how fast to increase the magnitude of ubi and to what degree okay despite my sort of libertarian political leanings i understand that at some point in the future we will need to redistribute wealth provide people with a safety net or something of that sort through the government or through private means big question though is when to start at what curve to increase the size of the program and to what overall degree should the program be implemented my personal opinion personally i think that the best way to start it would be to start by paying for people who have just lost their industries until they can get back into the workforce truck drivers fast food employees other people who will lose their jobs soon i think the best way for us to continue it is to carefully increase the availability of the payments as the new jobs people can easily move into decreases or maybe at this point we should try to merge humans with machines so that humans can feel some responsibility for the machines in the same way that you yourself aren t actually responsible for your ideas because they are formulated using the hardware of your brain but you still feel like it is a credit to you so would the machinery be optionally melded with your brain to give you some purpose i think the best way to cap out the resources that everyone would get would at first just be enough for them to survive in the particular area where they live few luxuries from there i think it would be best to only pay them more for luxuries as a bonus on what they earn themselves this means that they would still have a significant motivation to invent find a new job or just generally be productive it would also discourage illegal activity because you wouldn t get your income bonus on money earned in negative or zero sum games like gambling or theft

0,kurzweil s is our from how my predictions are faring with all instances of replaced with these are all of mid s ray kurzweil s predictions for dating back to the age of spiritual machines it s almost uncanny how precise he was so long as you shift the accuracy by a decade i d say roughly of his predictions accurately called the present day funnily enough the ones that missed the mark were the ones he himself said were wrong his main problem was trying to predict the consumer success of various technologies also don t be ultra pedantic about some wording like portable computer remember that he wrote all this in the mid s before terms like smartphone and cloud were common or even coined individuals primarily use portable computers portable computers will have become dramatically lighter and thinner than the notebook computers of ten years earlier personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry such as wristwatches rings earrings and other body ornaments computers with a high resolution visual interface range from rings and pins and credit cards up to the size of a thin book people typically have at least a dozen computers on and around their bodies which are networked using body lans local area networks for the most part these truly personal computers have no moving parts memory is completely electronic most portable computers do not have keyboards most users have servers in their homes and offices where they keep large stores of digital objects including their software databases documents music and movies digital objects such as books music albums movies and software are rapidly distributed as data files through the wireless network and typically do not have a physical object associated with them most users have servers where they keep digital objects such as virtual reality environments although these are still at an early stage there are services to keep one s digital objects in central repositories but most people prefer to keep their private information under their own physical control cables are disappearing communication between components such as pointing devices microphones displays printers and the occasional keyboard uses short distance wireless technology computers routinely include wireless technology to plug into the ever present worldwide network providing reliable instantly available very high bandwidth communication the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition csr dictation software but keyboards are still used csr is very accurate far more so than the human transcriptionists who were used up until a few years ago also ubiquitous are language user interfaces luis which combine continuous speech recognition csr and natural language understanding for routine matters such as simple business transactions and information inquiries luis are quite responsive and precise they tend to be narrowly focused however on specific types of tasks luis are frequently combined with animated personalities interacting with an animated personality to conduct a purchase or make a reservation is like talking to a person using videoconferencing except that the person is simulated computer displays have all the display qualities of paper high resolution high contrast large viewing angle and no flicker books magazines and newspapers are now routinely read on displays that are the size of well small books computer displays built into eyeglasses are also used these specialized glasses allow users to see the normal visual environment while creating a virtual image that appears to hover in front of the viewer the virtual images are created by a tiny laser built into the glasses that projects the images directly onto the user s retinas computers routinely include moving picture image cameras and are able to reliably identify their owners from their faces in terms of circuitry three dimensional chips are commonly used and there is a transition taking place from the older single layer chips sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three dimensional space this technology is based on creating audible frequency sounds from the spectrum created by the interaction of very high frequency tones as a result very small speakers can create very robust three dimensional sound a personal computer can perform about a trillion calculations per second supercomputers match at least the hardware capacity of the human brain million billion calculations per second petaflops unused computes on the internet are being harvested creating virtual parallel supercomputers with human brain hardware capacity there is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets genetic algorithms and other forms of chaotic or complexity theory computing although most computer computations are still done using conventional sequential processing albeit with some limited parallel processing autonomous nanoengineered machines i e machines constructed atom by atom and molecule by molecule have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls however nanoengineering is not yet considered a practical technology research has been initiated on reverse engineering the human brain through both destructive scans of the brains of recently deceased persons as well as noninvasive scans using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging mri of living persons and animals in the twentieth century computers in schools were mostly on the trailing edge with most effective learning from computers taking place in the home now in while schools are still not on the cutting edge the profound importance of the computer as a knowledge tool is widely recognized computers play a central role in all facets of education as they do in other spheres of life the majority of reading is done on displays although the installed base of paper documents is still formidable the generation of paper documents is dwindling as the books and other papers of largely twentieth century vintage are being rapidly scanned and stored documents circa routinely include embedded moving images and sounds students of all ages typically have a computer of their own which is a thin tablet like device weighing under a pound with a very high resolution display suitable for reading students interact with their computers primarily by voice and by pointing with a device that looks like a pencil keyboards still exist but most textual language is created by speaking learning materials are accessed through wireless communication intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning recent controversial studies have shown that students can learn basic skills such as reading and math just as readily with interactive learning software as with human teachers particularly when the ratio of students to human teachers is more than one to one although the studies have come under attack most students and their parents have accepted this notion for years the traditional mode of a human teacher instructing a group of children is still prevalent but schools are increasingly relying on software approaches leaving human teachers to attend primarily to issues of motivation psychological well being and socialization many children learn to read on their own using their personal computers before entering grade school preschool and elementary school children routinely read at their intellectual level using print to speech reading software until their reading skill level catches up these print to speech reading systems display the full image of documents and can read the print aloud while highlighting what is being read synthetic voices sound fully human although some educators expressed concern in the early years that students would rely unduly on reading software such systems have been readily accepted by children and their parents studies have shown that students improve their reading skills by being exposed to synchronized visual and auditory presentations of text learning at a distance e g lectures and seminars in which the participants are geographically scattered is commonplace learning is becoming a significant portion of most jobs training and developing new skills is emerging as an ongoing responsibility in most careers not just an occasional supplement as the level of skill needed for meaningful employment soars ever higher persons with disabilities are rapidly overcoming their handicaps through the intelligent technology of students with reading disabilities routinely ameliorate their disability using print to speech reading systems print to speech reading machines for the blind are now very small inexpensive palm sized devices that can read books those that still exist in paper form and other printed documents and other real world text such as signs and displays these reading systems are equally adept at reading the trillions of electronic documents that are instantly available from the ubiquitous wireless worldwide network after decades of ineffective attempts useful navigation devices have been introduced that can assist blind people in avoiding physical obstacles in their path and finding their way around using global positioning system gps technology a blind person can interact with her personal reading navigation systems through voice communication kind of like a seeing eye dog that reads and talks deaf persons or anyone with a hearing impairment commonly use portable speech to text listening machines which display a real time transcription of what people are saying the deaf user has the choice of either reading the transcribed speech as displayed text or watching an animated person gesturing in sign language these have eliminated the primary communication handicap associated with deafness listening machines can also translate what is being said into another language in real time so they are commonly used by hearing people as well computer controlled orthotic devices have been introduced these walking machines enable paraplegic persons to walk and climb stairs the prosthetic devices are not yet usable by all paraplegic persons as many physically disabled persons have dysfunctional joints from years of disuse however the advent of orthotic walking systems is providing more motivation to have these joints replaced there is a growing perception that the primary disabilities of blindness deafness and physical impairment do not necessarily impart handicaps disabled persons routinely describe their disabilities as mere inconveniences intelligent technology has become the great leveler translating telephone technology where you speak in english and your japanese friend hears you in japanese and vice versa is commonly used for many language pairs it is a routine capability of an individual s personal computer which also serves as her phone telephone communication is primarily wireless and routinely includes high resolution moving images meetings of all kinds and sizes routinely take place among geographically separated participants there is effective convergence at least on the hardware and supporting software level of all media which exist as digital objects i e files distributed by the ever present high bandwidth wireless information web users can instantly download books magazines newspapers television radio movies and other forms of software to their highly portable personal communication devices virtually all communication is digital and encrypted with keys available to government authorities many individuals and groups including but not limited to criminal organizations use an additional layer of virtually unbreakable encryption codes with no third party keys haptic technologies are emerging that allow people to touch and feel objects and other persons at a distance these force feedback devices are widely used in games and in training simulation systems interactive games routinely include all encompassing visual and auditory environments but a satisfactory all encompassing tactile environment is not yet available the online chat rooms of the late s have been replaced with virtual environments where you can meet people with full visual realism people have sexual experiences at a distance with other persons as well as virtual partners but the lack of the surround tactile environment has thus far kept virtual sex out of the mainstream virtual partners are popular as forms of sexual entertainment but they are more game like than real and phone sex is a lot more popular now that phones routinely include high resolution real time moving images of the person on the other end despite occasional corrections the ten years leading up to have seen continuous economic expansion and prosperity due to the dominance of the knowledge content of products and services the greatest gains continue to be in the value of the stock market price deflation concerned economists in the early years but they quickly realized it was a good thing the high tech community pointed out that significant deflation had existed in the computer hardware and software industries for many years earlier without detriment the united states continues to be the economic leader due to its primacy in popular culture and its entrepreneurial environment since information markets are largely world markets the u s has benefited greatly from its immigrant history being comprised of all the world s peoples specifically the descendants of peoples from around the globe who had endured great risk for a better life it has the ideal heritage for the new knowledge based economy china has also emerged as a powerful economic player europe has been somewhat quicker than japan and korea in adopting the american emphasis on venture capital employee stock options and tax policies that encourage entrepreneurship although these practices have become popular throughout the world at least half of all transactions are conducted on line intelligent assistants which combine continuous speech recognition natural language understanding problem solving and animated personalities routinely assist with finding information answering questions and conducting transactions intelligent assistants have become a primary interface for interacting with information based services with a wide range of choices available a recent poll shows that both male and female users prefer female personalities for their computer based intelligent assistants the two most popular are maggie who claims to be a waitress in a harvard square caf and michelle a stripper from new orleans personality designers are in demand and the field constitutes a growth area in software development most purchases of books musical albums videos games and other forms of software do not involve any physical object so new business models for distributing these forms of information have emerged one shops for these information objects by strolling through virtual malls sampling and selecting objects of interest rapidly and securely conducting an on line transaction and then quickly downloading the information using high speed wireless communication there are many types and gradations of transactions to gain access to these products you can buy a book musical album video etc which gives you unlimited permanent access alternatively you can rent access to read view or listen once or a few times or you can rent access by the minute access may be limited to one person or to a group of persons for example a family or a company alternatively access may be limited to a particular computer or to any computer accessed by a particular person or by a set of persons there is a strong trend towards the geographic separation of work groups people are successfully working together despite living and working in different places the average household has more than a hundred computers most of which are embedded in appliances and built in communication systems household robots have emerged but are not yet fully accepted intelligent roads are in use primarily for long distance travel once your car s computer guidance system locks onto the control sensors on one of these highways you can sit back and relax local roads though are still predominantly conventional hilariously kurzweil himself says this isn t just wrong but ten years off let s wait and see what will bring us a company west of the mississippi and north of the mason dixon line has surpassed a trillion dollars in market capitalization privacy has emerged as a primary political issue the virtually constant use of electronic communication technologies is leaving a highly detailed trail of every person s every move litigation of which there has been a great deal has placed some constraints on the widespread distribution of personal data government agencies however continue to have the right to gain access to people s files which has resulted in the popularity of unbreakable encryption technologies there is a growing neo luddite movement as the skill ladder continues to accelerate upwards as with earlier luddite movements its influence is limited by the level of prosperity made possible by new technology the movement does succeed in establishing continuing education as a primary right associated with employment there is continuing concern with an underclass that the skill ladder has left far behind the size of the underclass appears to be stable however although not politically popular the underclass is politically neutralized through public assistance and the generally high level of affluence the high quality of computer screens and the facilities of computer assisted visual rendering software have made the computer screen a medium of choice for visual art most visual art is the result of collaboration between human artists and their intelligent art software virtual paintings high resolution wall hung displays have become popular rather than always displaying the same work of art as with a conventional painting or poster these virtual paintings can change the displayed work at the user s verbal command or can cycle through collections of art the displayed artwork can be works by human artists or original art created in real time by cybernetic art software human musicians routinely jam with cybernetic musicians the creation of music has become available to persons who are not musicians creating music does not necessarily require the fine motor coordination of using traditional controllers cybernetic music creation systems allow people who appreciate music but who are not knowledgeable about music theory and practice to create music in collaboration with their automatic composition software interactive brain generated music which creates a resonance between the user s brainwaves and the music being listened to is another popular genre musicians commonly use electronic controllers which emulate the playing style of the old acoustic instruments e g piano guitar violin drums but there is a surge of interest in the new air controllers in which you create music by moving your hands feet mouth and other body parts other music controllers involve interacting with specially designed devices writers use voice activated word processing grammar checkers are now actually useful distribution of written documents from articles to books typically does not involve paper and ink style improvement and automatic editing software is widely used to improve the quality of writing language translation software is also widely used to translate written works in a variety of languages nonetheless the core process of creating written language is less affected by intelligent software technologies than the visual and musical arts however cybernetic authors are emerging beyond music recordings images and movie videos the most popular type of digital entertainment object is virtual experience software these interactive virtual environments allow you to go whitewater rafting on virtual rivers to hang glide in a virtual grand canyon or to engage in intimate encounters with your favorite movie star users also experience fantasy environments with no counterpart in the physical world the visual and auditory experience of virtual reality is compelling but tactile interaction is still limited the security of computation and communication is the primary focus of the u s department of defense there is general recognition that the side that can maintain the integrity of its computational resources will dominate the battlefield humans are generally far removed from the scene of battle warfare is dominated by unmanned intelligent airborne devices many of these flying weapons are the size of small birds or smaller the u s continues to be the world s dominant military power which is largely accepted by the rest of the world as most countries concentrate on economic competition military conflicts between nations are rare and most conflicts are between nations and smaller bands of terrorists the greatest threat to national security comes from bioengineered weapons bioengineered treatments have reduced the toll from cancer heart disease and a variety of other health problems significant progress is being made in understanding the information processing basis of disease telemedicine is widely used physicians can examine patients using visual auditory and haptic examination from a distance health clinics with relatively inexpensive equipment and a single technician bring health care to remote areas where doctors had previously been scarce computer based pattern recognition is routinely used to interpret imaging data and other diagnostic procedures the use of noninvasive imaging technologies has substantially increased diagnosis almost always involves collaboration between a human physician and a pattern recognition based expert system doctors routinely consult knowledge based systems generally through two way voice communication augmented by visual displays which provide automated guidance access to the most recent medical research and practice guidelines lifetime patient records are maintained in computer databases privacy issues concerning access to these records as with many other data bases of personal information have emerged as a major issue doctors routinely train in virtual reality environments which include a haptic interface these systems simulate the visual auditory and tactile experience of medical procedures including surgery simulated patients are available for continuing medical education for medical students and for people who just want to play doctor there is renewed interest in the turing test first proposed by alan turing in as a means for testing intelligence in a machine recall that the turing test contemplates a situation in which a human judge interviews the computer and a human foil communicating with both over terminal lines if the human judge is unable to tell which interviewee is human and which is machine the machine is deemed to possess human level intelligence although computers still fail the test confidence is increasing that they will be in a position to pass it within another one or two decades there is serious speculation on the potential sentience i e consciousness of computer based intelligence the increasingly apparent intelligence of computers has spurred an interest in philosophy computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible woven into our clothing embedded in our furniture and environment computers will tap into the worldwide mesh aka the cloud what the world wide web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating web servers thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks of high speed communications and computational resources we ll have very high bandwidth wireless communication to the internet at all times displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas similar tiny devices will project auditory environments these resources will provide high resolution full immersion visual auditory virtual reality at any time we will also have augmented reality with displays overlaying the real world to provide real time guidance and explanations we ll have real time translation of foreign languages essentially subtitles on the world we ll have access to many forms of online information in our daily activities virtual personalities that overlay the real world will help us with information retrieval and our chores and transactions these virtual assistants won t always wait for questions and directives but will step forward if they see us struggling to find a piece of information

0,the future as a natural selection event on the world was ruled by europeans and the sole exception was japan every other nominally independent countries were that way because various european powers decided to share influence over some countries rather than carve them for themselves for example persia was a joint playground of russia and england while ottoman turkey was turning into an appendage of germany social darwinism was the strongest at that time too after the great war the presence of millions of lower class with military experience forced the elites to co opt them and after world war social darwinism became passe however in the future there will be no jobs except those who are very very very smart who will have jobs pertaining to the needs of the new civilization those who lack the skills to secure a high paying position in the new civilization will be in very bad shape and will be in no position to propagate i think that as resources are consolidated in the hands of the most able and and most ruthless they will probably stop caring about the less able less intelligent less wealthy etc since these people no longer affect their wealth well being existence etc the future is brutal the financialization of everything means there is no more slack for the less able to get lucky everyone will live like singaporeans who know they can never be closer to the family of lee kwan yew who set up things so his descendants would be the richest in singapore for ever but will make peace with it and will try to live their their lives according to their positions i think that barring any kind of unforeseen catastrophe such as resource shortages something i have talked about here a few times the displacement of the less able less intelligent and less wealthy by those who are more able etc will be completed before singularity immortal words said by america s greatest men by displacing the natives they created the greatest civilization on earth so what they did was a good thing in a utilitarian way although the natives did not like it too much william henry harrison s immortal words is one of the fairest portions of the globe to remain in a state of nature the haunt of a few wretched savages when it seems destined by the creator to give support to a large population and to be the seat of civilization such philosophy drove civilization and by concentrating all resources to the more able we will hopefully reach the space before it is too late as i have said a few times maybe million people with a cap of no more than m as the inscription at the georgia guidestones says of the world s better people will get to enjoy the future although at least billion people won t like it too much it is evolution trying to stop it is not beneficial and might destroy the future altogether instead it is important to educate the people of the world that some are more able and more deserving than others and the rest of the world should defer and sacrifice for the better ones like the people of japan and singapore have learned to do so the only regret is there is no way to recover the resources the world s billion people had wasted a century of horizontal growth instead of vertical growth which is the only way to advance civilization has destroyed too much resources and may actually cost us the best chance to conquer space
0,viral outbreaks are the greatest threat to our survival in the future since most of the world has invested so little into healthcare no one could have possibly predicted that the coronavirus could wreak havoc on the economy and on society like it has businesses are ordering their offices to shut down people to work remote theme parks shutting down supermarkets are completely out of essential resources for survival people are flocking to supermarkets to drain them of essential resources and ironically exposing themselves to the virus but worst of all is the healthcare cost of the virus and the difficulty in treating it there s no cure at all for a viral outbreak process that for a moment no cure none sure you can make a vaccine but that s not effective and it takes a lot of time and energy even worse is healthcare most of the nation can t afford the test k to test for coronavirus let alone the treatment it could cost upwards of with insurance this is for one single virus that isn t too dissimilar to the flu and it s causing widespread fear chaos panic in the future viral outbreaks are our biggest threat because viruses are constantly evolving there are new ones every few years there aren t enough medical personnel to address an outbreak and worst of all no developed country has the resources to handle an outbreak effectively none even free healthcare countries don t because there aren t enough medical personnel but we re not really addressing the problem

0,solar system wide lag compensation nuanced i have an idea for mars earth lunar solar space lag compensation sounds impossible maybe but it s all about machines telling stories the type of lag compensation is very different from the type we use in video games today though as what we use in video games today simply wouldn t work for the up to almost hour or longer depending on how straight the connections are delays of a solar system spanning local internet in the event that faster than light communication is impossible not everyone stays near earth and it is infeasible to send all the information for human brains interplanetary in a future where we can create immersive faster than real time simulations and have mid to high bandwidth interplanetary internet connections perhaps due to swarms of satellite relays using optical technology to send and receive signals this solution applies we could send text files with code representing in machine language general information about a person a gigabyte personality test and a gigabyte details file for example two gigabytes for each person transferred from locations in the solar system to a planet or spacecraft or multiple planets and spacecraft if required for extra processing then sentient super fast machines would construct a gigantic story of people all over the solar system interacting with each other without lag based on the data given about them this is then distributed in chunks to the relevant recipients and if needed edits can be made to the story before confirmation is given the transmitted story could efficiently not involve physics simulations and basically be like a book if this method is chosen the streaming requirements would not be very high everyone involved would experience themselves as being in the situation their chunk of the story provides as their experience would be dictated directly by microscopic machines controlling their neurons their stories could be about anything and though they wouldn t be fooled their experience would crucially be fooled that the story was happening it would be undistinguished from actually happening like a conveyor belt the story would be generated added to and streamed constantly by machines so everyone who wants to could spend the rest of their lives in their chunk of the story or hop out and back into it if their personality called for it any inconsistencies in the story with users personalities would just be ignored and prevented from being perceived by the users this is all physically possible i think so the rest is just up to engineering like with the internet survival population control and any other sciences please discuss this topic if you find it interesting are otherwise not occupied and can make a contribution to the topic discussions are good thank you

0,st century gun safety technology speculation and debate technology integration should be a priority its not a question of how but when technology will integrate itself into all aspects of everyday life including gun safety im just bringing up logical realistic expectations that will more then likley come to pass as technology becomes more overlapping in society and more integrated into everyday aspects and tools every edge and tool of safety and response technology can provide should be and will be at the public and st responders disposal for safety and security overtime it s efficient will reach beyond human expectations do you see any of theses technology being used for gun safety technology would preserving gun rights of sensible and mature gun owners along with increasing gun safety equally and in my opinion safety should be paramount and and equal to the preservation the rights bio metric hand print recognition on gun grips telling the difference between a adult and a child or even the gun owner finger print recognition on all triggers to know and identify and create accountability what are some ideas or technology that would help with gun safety in the st century gps technlogy how many cars use it why not have it built in to every gun indicate where and when the gun was fired how many shots were fired alerting authority s when fired or to not allow it to fire or work inside a school church etc if tampered with or offline for to long it would cause it to not work at all and alerts the authority s the authority s should pay the gun owner a vist first times warning third time fine for each gun not connected to the system as they already have gps for state parks for every day hikers i can also see this being helpful during hunting season being able to see the location of other hunters in the hunting grounds and highlighting the areas of possible game some of you will say what if it is hacked well there is a encryption based currency called bitcoin at this point that is unhackable why not use the same software mechanics some encryption that exist would take s of years to achieve as is make it a federal crime if tampered with and have fail safes to notify the authority s some will say what about the battery mah can last for upto year per charge and with moores law they will only get smaller and efferent not a question of how but when
